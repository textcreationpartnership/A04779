            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Our life, (as <hi>IOB</hi> ſaieth <hi>cap. 7.</hi>) is <hi>Militia ſuper terram; A warfare,</hi> in which we ſtand alwaies vpon our guarde, alwaies in our armour, alwayes with weapon in hand: but it is a <hi>warfare on earth,</hi> for in heauen it is a peace; a labour here, a reſt there; a ſowing in teares here, a

            <p>
               <hi>3.</hi> In this Armie, you, (ô valiant and conſtant Catholikes) are placed, as in the moſt dangerous, ſo in the moſt honourable rancke and place. For as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall placeth there his moſt expert and hardie ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, where the enemies Canon playeth ofteneſt, the darts and arrowes flye thickeſt, the pikes are planted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8380:4"/>like a wood moſt terriblie: ſo our King <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> vnder whoſe banner and colours you fight, knowing your vndaunted courage to be ſuch that <hi>(abſit verbo inuidia)</hi> you are the moſt valiant ſouldiers of the preſent Church militant: he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you against a wood of Pikes, against a shower of Bullets and Pellets, against the moſt furious aſſault, that the common enemie giueth to the Chriſtian Armie, and Church militant of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4.</hi> For whereas Chriſtians amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> can buy their libertie of Conſcience for money, you by no tribute can purchaſe ſuch a fauour. And whereas in <hi>Holland,</hi> and other countries, the Magiſtrate layeth handes on Prieſts and Catholikes, only when he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them at Maſſe, or diuine ſeruice; you are ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for more diligently then theeues, murderers, and publike harlots, and are apprehended, euen in the ſtreetes and fieldes. And although in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> Catholikes haue heretofore endured intollerable pillages, cruell deathes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet that furie lasted onely a while, whilest the furie of hereſie raged in her hoate beginning: but againſt you the like furie hath long continued. That cruelty was practiſed onely by way of tumult, but against you the like sharpnes hath bin vſed, vnder the colour of law, &amp; shew of iuſtice: So that no Nation, no people Chriſtian endureth at this day for Chriſt his Church, and her Paſtours authoritie, that which you haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for theſe many yeares, without interruption. And whereas the more raging the Tempeſt is, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is appeaſed: &amp; the more furious &amp; bloudie the battaile is, the ſooner it is ended: you haue this long ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſuffered a violent and furious perſecution, and yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8380:4"/>you ſee no ende of this furie, yea, no hope of an ende, by humane meanes, oulde ſtatutes being ſtill renewed, new enacted. So that you are placed in that place of Chriſts Armie, which is expoſed to the greateſt furie of the Enemie: yea, you are ſet as a Butt or marke, against which, the enemies of Gods Church, are permitted to diſcharge all their Artillarie, and to emptie the quiuers of all the pearſing arrowes of afflictions, againſt you: and fo you may ſay as <hi>IOB</hi> did <hi>(Iob. 16.) Poſuit me quaſi ſignum. He bath ſet me to him ſelue as it were a marck</hi> to shoote at. And ſeeing that he bath bene ſo long a ſpectator of theſe shottes, and furious aſſaultes, it ſeemech he taketh delight and pleaſure, not in your enimies crueltie and furie, but in your dexteritie in warding, conſtancie in keeping your ſtanding, patience in ſuffering and enduring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5.</hi> And truely your afflictions ſeeme to me, neither inferiour, nor vnlike to thoſe of <hi>IOB,</hi> and your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſeemeth to match and to aequalize his; only the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your afflictions ſeeme different. For he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted firſt in his goods, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his perſon; you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, firſt in your bodies and liues; now in your goods and liuings. The <hi>Sabeians</hi> haue rushed in vpon you, as well as on <hi>IOB,</hi> and haue ſpoyled many of you, impouerished the reſt. <hi>Irruerunt Sabei, tulerunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que omnia. (Iob. 1.) The</hi> Sabeians <hi>came in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, and haue taken all things from you, the fire alſo of God, fell from heauen, and ſtriking the sheepe</hi> (of <hi>IOB,</hi>) <hi>and the ſeruants hath conſumed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. (Iob. 1.)</hi> and a fire not from heauen (vnleſſe by diuine permiſsion) but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, yea, from hell, and the vnquenchable thirſt of hauing, hath conſumed all your ſubſtance. The <hi>Chaldees</hi> made
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8380:5"/>three troupes to inuade the Camels of <hi>IOB,</hi> &amp; ſtroke his ſeruants with the ſword. <hi>(Iob 1.)</hi> So haue they by three troupes, to wit, <hi>Concupiſcentia carnis</hi> Concupiſcence of the flesh. <hi>(1. Ioan. 2.) Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentia oculorum,</hi> concupiſcence of the eyes, and <hi>Superbia vitae,</hi> pride of life, inuaded you: becauſe to ſatisfie their luſt and carnalitie, their auarice, deſire of riches, and all that may be ſeene by the eyes, their pride and ambition of greatneſſe, they haue made hauocke of all you haue. A vehement winde blowing boyſterousſly from the countrey of the Defert, shooke the foure Corners of <hi>Iobs</hi> houſe, which falling, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Children. <hi>(Iob. 5.)</hi> The like whirle winde, from the North, and deſert of hereſie, hath shaken your houſes, and by their fall, hath ruinated your families, oppreſſed your perſons, your wiues and children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6.</hi> And leaſt the deuill should exprobate vnto you, as he did to <hi>IOB,</hi> that hetherto your goods haue rather ſuffered, then you; and that therefore if God would touch your bodie, and corporal life, hee should ſoone ſee you breake out into impatience (<hi>becauſe skinne for skinne, and all things that a man hath, he will giue for his life, Iob. 2,</hi> God hath permitted Satan, by his miniſters, to haue power ouer your bodies, and corporal life alſo, as appeareth by the priſons, in which ſome of you haue rotted, ſome haue ſtatued, ſome haue been choaked with ſtincking ayres, as may eaſilye bee ſeene by the rackes, in which your ioyntes haue been diſſolued, by the Tyburnes, on which you haue been hanged, and vnder which you haue been moſt butcherlie quartered, &amp; vnbowelled. Yea, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your affliction, many of you haue not wanted a <hi>IOBS</hi> wife, carnal and worldly loue, to buſſe in your

To theſe I'deſire you to adde the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, not only Prouincial, but alſo General, which in their decrees haue defined this authoritie; the Popes ſo many, ſo learned, ſo holie, who haue exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized it vpon rebellious Princes; the Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours (though moſt herein intereſſed) who haue acknowledged it; the arguments alſo deducted out of Scripture, and Principles of faith and Diuinitie, which do conuince it, (all which this booke will make known vnto you) and laſtly the fatherlie admonition of your moſt Holie Father and chiefe viſible Pastour <hi>PAVL</hi> by the Grace of God the fifte of that name, who as by office he hath a generall charge and care of all Chriſtian Nations, ſo hath he a particular care, not only of the ſpirituall, but alſo of the temporall eſtates of all English Catholikes, as our Colledges haue, and do daiely experience, and conſequentlie would not expoſe your temporall eſtates to the furie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour, by forbidding you this <hi>oath,</hi> if (as he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you) it did not containe thinges, which can not be ſworne without <hi>euident and grieuous wronging of Gods honour, and which are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8380:11"/>flat contrarie to faith and ſaluation. (Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> 5. <hi>in Breu.)</hi> And therfore ſeeing that hee, like a wiſe and carefull Phiſitian, hath more care of your health, then of contenting your taſt and humour; and <hi>VViddrington</hi> contrariewiſe permitteth you that which is pleaſing to flesh, and bloud, not ſo much reſpecting how preiudicious it is to your ſoules health; if you will preferre heauen before a temporall eſtate, and the ſoule before the bodie, you muſt alſo preſerre your Holie Fathers counſel and admonition, eſpeciallie grounded in ſuch authoritie, before all the ſmooth and ſoothing preſcriptions in the world, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by onlie <hi>Widdringtons,</hi> and ſome few obſcure Authors authoritie: for although he alleadgeth often the Doctors of <hi>Sotbon,</hi> and all the ſtate of <hi>France,</hi> yet by the late reſiſtance made by the Clergie, and nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> against the like <hi>Oath,</hi> who ſeeth not how he abuſeth his reader and iniureth that noble Monarchie?</p>
            <p>

For to omitte that if you had at the firſt iointlie and couragionſlie reſiſted the <hi>oath,</hi> it is like you should neuer haue been ſo hoatlie preſſed with it; if now you should all reſolue to accept of it, neither ſo should you auoide perſecution. For (as I haue tould you) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce your yeelding in this point hath prouoked your heauenlie Fathers wrath, and induced him in this his ſo iuſtlie conceiued anger, to vſe or permitt ſtill the rodd of perſecution, which otherwiſe he was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8380:12"/>readie to haue layed aſide: and the perſecutour, who propoſeth this oath, not ſeeking ſo much the Princes ſecuritie (which rather hereby, as I haue shewed in the laſt chapter of this booke, is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered) as the moleſtation of your Conſciences, and the pillage of your goods, would not, though you should accept of this <hi>oath,</hi> ſurceaſe therfore from perſecution; but if he could not by this meanes molest your conſciences, and ruine your eſtates, he would try other meanes, as to compell you to their Churches or prophane Communion. And this you may gather by his ſorrow he shewed, when in the beginning ſo many of you yeelded to take this <hi>oath;</hi> and by this alſo, that many, who haue taken this oath, can not ſo free them ſelues from moleſtation, becauſe nothing but your goods and miſeries can ſatisfie the vnſatiable crueltie of bloudie perſecutours. And ſo by yeelding to this <hi>oath,</hi> as you prouoke Gods greater anger, ſo you moue the perſecutour to no compaſsion; rather you make him more inſolent, and redouble your owne miſerie.

I deny not but that in reſpect of imperfect ſocieties, to wit, families, the good man of the houſe, by law of Nature is ſuperiour, and that at firſt, all power was in the head of euery fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie; but when families increaſing, men met together in Cities and Common wealthes, then none in particular had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to gouerne that new communitie, and ſo the power was reſident in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie.

The firſt gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it ſelfe is beſt, becauſe it is eaſier to finde one good and wiſe man, then few, much more hard to find many; and it is eaſier for many to obey one, then many; for to obey many, there are two difficulties; the one in thoſe that obey, and that difficultie is alſo found in a Monarchie; the ſecond in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and this is leſſe in a Monarchie, then in other gouernments, becauſe one can better agree then many, and ſo when one commandeth, it is eaſier for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to agree in one, then when many command.

               <p n="7">7. Now therefore, as the Communitie (as is before declared) hath power to gouerne it ſelfe; ſo hath it power to chooſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which it liketh beſt, whether it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8380:24"/>be one of the former three ſimple gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or ſome other mixt of two, or of all three of them. And if the Communitie chooſeth Magiſtrates, who shall depend of the whole Communitie, then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie is the chiefe gouernour, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are but officers and miniſters, and ſo may be depoſed by the people, ſome times at pleaſure, ſome tymes only vpon ſome vrgent occaſion; and alwayes when the chiefe Magiſtrate dyeth, his heyres ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not neceſſarily, but only they, whom the people make choiſe of. This gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was amongeſt the Romanes, when they were gouerned by <hi>Plebiſcita,</hi> and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; and is this day to be ſeene in the Common VVealth of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Geneuians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Genua.</hi> If the Communitie make choiſe of a King, then the Communitie despoileth it ſelf of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and becometh a ſubiect, and as it were a priuate perſon, and giueth all power and Authoritie to the King to gouerne, not principallie for his owne priuate, but for the common good of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And hence it is that the Common wealth cannot depoſe a King, as it may a Magiſtrate, vnles it be in caſe of intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tyrannie.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hence appeareth a great difference betwixt the afore ſaid power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie, and the Regall power of the King, becauſe the former power of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8380:24"/>followeth of neceſſitie the lawfull meeting of many in one ſocietie, in ſo much that it is not in the peoples power to meet with intention to liue together, and not to haue that power; and ſo this power depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of any election: but that the King, or Peeres, or the Magiſtrate rule, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, depended at the firſt of the election, and free choiſe of the people, in whoſe power it was to chooſe one or many to gouerne the reſt, and ſo Kinglie power is in deede of God, but by meanes of election. It is of God, becauſe it proceeded from the Communities power, which is of God and Nature, neceſſarilie following the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination, which God hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vs to liue in ſocietie; and yet it is in the King by free election, becauſe though the Communitie haue authoritie from God and Nature to rule it ſelf, yet that this power is giuen to the determinate perſon of the King, dependeth of the peoples ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8380:32"/>honour God in ſocietie. And ſo although God had left vs to Nature, and had not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained vs to Grace or Glorie; yet in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſocieties, there had beene two Powers, the one <hi>Ciuill,</hi>

And in this caſe theſe Powers had beene diſtinguished in reſpect of their diuers actes and endes, and should moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſlie haue beene committed to diuers perſons, or Magiſtrates and Prieſts; but then the Eccleſiaſticall power had not had the power to exerciſe any ſupernaturall Actes, being not ordained in that caſe to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall end, and proceeding only from Nature and naturall inclination, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>But if we diſpute not of that which might haue beene, but that which is; then we muſt confeſſe that all Eccleſiaſticall Power, which is now vnder the lawe of Chriſt, and was heretofore vnder the law of Moyſes, proceedeth from God his poſitiue ordinance, Inſtitution, and conſtitution. For as God preuented the Iewes, and whereas they by lawe of Nature had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to chooſe their Kinges, yet for their greater good, he choſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one him ſelue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie: ſo although by the lawe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, men otherwiſe might haue preſcribed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8380:33"/>the manner of worshipping God, and the worship had been lawfull, ſo that it had been the worship of the true God, and had been free from ſuperſtition; yet becauſe God hath ordained vs to a ſupernaturall end, and would haue our Eccleſiaſticall gouernment free from all ſuperſtition, he hath himſelfe appointed the manner of gouernment, and hath giuen the Authoritie. So in the lawe of Moyſes he choſe the Tribe of LEVI to ſerue in the Tabernacle and Temple, and to menage Eccleſiaſticall matters; he inſtituted alſo ſacrifices, ſacramentes, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: in like ſort in the new lawe of Grace (vnder which we liue) he committed the gouernment of his Church to the Apoſtles and Diſciples only, and their ſucceſſours; he inſtituted ſeuen Sacramentes, and a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; he gaue vs a lawe and beleefe, which firſt he deliuered by preaching, then by the written Ghoſpelles, and Epiſtles of his Apoſtles; and other thinges he committed to the Church, which he had inſtituted and eſtablished.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Torti pa.</hi> 363.</note> So doth alſo D. ANDREWES. But if I should graunt them that all theſe were by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Rulers of the Synagogue; yet could it not thence be inferred that Princes are to gouerne the Church of Chriſt. For <hi>firſt</hi> the Synagogue was more terrene and Leſſe perfect then the Church; and ſo as their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8380:64"/>and Prieſts were terrene in reſpect of ours, ſo God might haue giuen them terrene Princes for their chiefe Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſuperiours, which manner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to be made a patterne for the gouernment of the Church of CHRIST, this being a more perfect common wealth, more ſpirituall, gouerned by more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Paſtours, enriched with a more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſacrifice and Sacraments. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> if Princes then were rulers of the Synagogue, it was by Gods ſpeciall and Indiciall law, and ſeing the Iudiciall and Ceremoniall lawes are abrogated, they can not binde Chriſtians; or if <hi>Bilſon</hi> will needs haue it, that Chriſtian Princes muſt now gouerne the Church, becauſe they then ruled the Synagogue, one might inferre that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of England muſt be circumcized, and muſt offer Caldes, becauſe then the Iewish Prieſts did ſo. VVherfore that law as Ceremoniall and Iudiciall, being abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, we muſt looke to the new law; in which not withſtanding there is no one Text or example, that giueth Princes the rule of the Church. <hi>Thirdlie</hi> I anſwere that none of all the Kings alledged by D. <hi>Bilſon</hi> and D. <hi>Andrewes</hi> did gouerne the Synagogue in Eccleſiaſticall matters, but did onlie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the prieſts, that gouerned and punnished Malefactours and tranſgreſſours of the law,

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8380:64"/>his anſwere to our ſoueraine hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlie declared.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſecond argument againſt Princes ſpirituall ſupremacie shall be this. If a Prince hath authoritie to gouerne the Church of his Kingdome, either he hath it preciſelie becauſe he is a King, or becauſe he is a Chriſtian King; but by neither of theſe waies he hath it; <hi>ergo</hi> by no way he hath it. Not becauſe he is a King; for Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glie power only medleth with temporall and humane matters, and therfore Kings are called <hi>Humanae Creaturae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Petri.</hi> 2.</note> humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and they haue their authoritie from the people in manner afore ſayd, which people can giue no Eccleſiaſticall power, that being ſpirituall and ſupernaturall; yea if Kings as Kings had this Authoritie, then the Kinges which raigned in the Apoſtles time, though Infidels, should haue been Heads of the Church, although they were no members at all, and conſequentlie NERO should haue been Head of the Church, and all the Apoſtles, and the sheepe of Chriſt had bene committed to a Rauening Wolfe; which though it be moſt abſurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, yet TOMSOM, as BECANVS in his booke entituled <hi>the English Iarre</hi> reciteth, is not ashamed to auouch, it ſaying: <hi>Omnes Principes etiam Pagani obiectiuè habent ſupremam poteſtatem in omnes omnino perſonas ſuorum ſubditorum, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratim in res ipſas, ſiue ciuiles ſunt, ſiue ſacrae, All Princes, euen Paganes, obiectiuelie haue ſupreme
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8380:65"/>Authoritie ouer all the perſons of their ſubiectes, and generallie ouer their goods, whether they be Ciuill or holy.</hi> Not becauſe he is a Chriſtian King, becauſe Baptiſme, by which he is made a Chriſtian and member of the Church, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the King no new power, no more then it doth to others that are baptized: And therfore if before Baptiſme he be no Head of the Church, neither is he after Baptiſme, rather Baptiſme, as aboue we haue ſeene, maketh him a ſubiect to the Church, wheras before he was not, and only giueth him a new charge to obey, ſerue, and aſſiſt the Church. VVherby it may appeare how fowlie Doctour ANDREWS was deceiued when he ſayd, That an Ethnick King, when he becommeth a Chriſtian, gaineth and getteth a new right and power ouer the Church and Spirituall matters: for theſe are his wordes: <hi>Quin Rex quiuis,
<note place="margin">

Yea euery King when of an Ethnike he becometh Christian, doth not looſe his terrene right, but getteth a new right in the ſpirituall goods of the Church.</hi> And Citing <hi>Bellarmine</hi> he ſayth: <hi>Omnia haec Dominus tuus totidem verbis; All thoſe things thy Maſter (Bellarmin) in ſo many words affirmeth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bollar. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Pont. ca.</hi> 2. &amp; 3.</note> as though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had affirmed that a Pagan King were Head of the Church, and had right and power in ſpirituall matters, whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is too learned to make ſo groſſe an errour, and only affirmeth That
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8380:65"/>Pagan Kings, are true Princes and Lords of their Countries.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But perchance they will ſay that the Prince hath this Authoritie by a ſpeciall Graunt from God him ſelf. This they may ſay, but with how little reaſon, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that, which alreadie I haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Chapter; for I haue prooued out of ſcripture, that Chriſt gaue all Authoritie concerning the gouernment of the Church to his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, and not any at all to Kings and Princes. VVhich becauſe our ſtate pleaſers perceaued well enough, they are enforced to play the Iewes, and to alledge examples out of the old law, as D. <hi>Bilſon</hi> and D. ANDREWS do, which examples not witſtanding, as I haue shewed, do not firt their purpoſe; for they knew, and D. ANDREWS confeſſeth (ſaying, <hi>Exemplum inde nobis ſnmendum eſt,

If any anſwere that by Common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they may either chooſe one to call the reſt, or being all equall, they may meete alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one; neither will this ſerue: For as for the firſt meanes, it is morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe Kinges, who haue high aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mindes, would neuer be drawen to ſubiect them ſelues to any, and ſo whilſt euerie one would be Chiefe, none should be Chiefe.

Octob. and in another an. Domini 1554. Likewiſe King HENRIE <hi>the Eight,</hi> in the Parlament holden the 22. of Ianuary and 34. of his raigne in the yeare of our Lord 1542. condemned Tindals Translation of the Bible, and all bookes written againſt the Bleſſed Sacrament, and forbad the Bible to be redd in English in any Church, which ſtatutes were repealed by King EDWARD at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> an 1.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8380:70"/>was renewed by Queen MARIE in the firſt yeare of her raigne an. Domini 1553. and repealed againe by Queen ELIZABETH in the firſt yeare of her raigne. So that if Kings be heads of the Church, and haue ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, we shall haue as many Religions almoſt, as Kinges. And euen as King HBNRIE <hi>the Eight</hi> after his vſurpation of the ſupremacie, changed his wiues, and made his mariages lawfull and vnlawfull, his children legitimat and illegitimat at his pleaſure, and by Authoritie alſo of the Parlament, which durſt not gaineſaie; ſo euery King shall haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to change religion, and muſt be obeyed as the onlie ſupreme Head in earth of the Church For as King HENRIE <hi>the Eight,</hi> and his young Sonne King EDWARD, and his Daughter Queene ELIZABETH chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged Authoritie to redreſſe errours, and correct hereſies, to giue validitie to all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall lawes and Synodes; as King HENRIE made it Hereſie to denie the Reall Preſence, ſo another King of <hi>England,</hi> or of another Kingdome, may decree the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. As King HENRIE forbad Prieſts to marrie; ſo another King will permit them to marrie. As King HENRIE commanded the Bibles to be read, and diuine ſeruice to be ſayd, and ſong in Latin; ſo another will like better of the vulgar tongue of his owne Countrie: and if you ſay, that the King is tyed to the word of God, euerie one of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8380:70"/>them will ſay, that they follow the word of God, hauing the Authoritie to iudge of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and conſequentlie of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sixtlie,</hi> if Princes were Heads of the Church, a ridiculous conſequence, and of which euen the Kinges and Queenes of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> haue bene ashamed, would follow; to wit, that they may preach, miniſter Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, excommunicate, call Councels and ſit as iudges in them &amp;c.

So that if the Prince be Head of the Church, he is Paſtour; but it pertaineth to the office of a Paſtour to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his sheepe by lawes, to feede them with bread of the word of God,

VVherefore King HENRIE <hi>the Eight,</hi> as he challenged the Title of ſupreme Head, ſo he challenged almoſt all this Authoritie, as we haue ſeene. And to Queene ELIZABETH in the firſt <hi>Parlament,</hi> and firſt yeare of her raigne, the like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was graunted.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8380:71"/>by Authoritie from her Regall Maieſtie. And hence it is, that the Prince writeth to the Archbishop in this manner: <hi>For as much as all Iuriſdiction, as well Eccleſiaſticall, as ſecular, proceedeth from Kinglie power, as from the Head; we giue thee Power to promote by theſe preſents to holy Orders</hi> &amp;c.

This argueth that in England all Eccleſiaſticall Iurisdiction to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, abſolue, to preach, and miniſter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to call Synodes, to decree in them, to make Eccleſiaſticall lawes &amp;c. procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Prince, as from the Head and fountaine; and conſequentlie ſeing that what Authoritie the Prince giueth to others, he hath him ſelf, hee may excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, make Eccleſiaſticall lawes, call Councels, ſitt as ſupreme Iudge in them, as others by his Authoritie doe. And ſeing he can giue to others Iurisdiction to giue Orders, he may alſo miniſter Sacraments, preach, and teach; for this Authoritie he giueth to others. And therfore as in all Common wealthes, the Prince can do thoſe thinges, which his inferiour Officers do, though it be not alwaies ſo conuenient; ſo, if all Eccleſiaſticall power proceedeth from the King as from the Head and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, looke what the Bishops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can do by Authoritie receaued from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8380:72"/>him, that he alſo him ſelf may do; which yet is ſo ridiculous, that our Princes hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto haue bene ashamed of manie of thoſe offices; and as we shall ſee anon, euen the Proteſtants of England, when they are preſſed, are ashamed of this monſtrous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>

If you ſay that S. PETER, and his ſucceſſours were heads till CONSTANTINE, then I demaund, who depoſed Pope SYLVESTER, when CONSTANTINE came to be Chriſtian, and conſequently Head? or if S.

Which yet I ſee not how it can ſtand together; for if the King be ſupreme Head, not only ouer the Kingdome, but alſo ouer the Church, that is, of the perſons of the Church; then as, becauſe he is ſupreme Head of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he can command his laye ſubiects in temporall matters, as to paie Tribute, to obey temporall lawes &amp;c. ſo if he be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Head of the Church, and hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer Clergie men, as Clergie men, he can command euen Churchmen in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall matters, and can call Synodes, determine controuerſies of faith in them, enact Eccleſiaſticall lawes, and beſtowe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Benefices; and ſo he shall haue Authoritie, not onlie ouer the perſons, but alſo ouer the things of the Church.

For if the King be Head of the perſons of the Church, he can command them as his ſubiects; And then I demand of BILSON, in what things he can command them? If in temporall thinges onlie, as to paie Tribute, to go to warre &amp;c. then is he King only of the Common wealth, but no Head of the Church: If in Spirituall things, as admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments, deciſions of matters of faith in Councels &amp;c. then hath he the adminiſtration of ſpirituall things, and hath authority, not only ouer the perſons, but alſo ouer the things of the Church.

               <p n="1">1. HAuing shewed by manie Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the former Chapter, that the Prince neither hath any ſpirituall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, neither can by his Temporall power entermeddle him ſelf as a Superiour in matters Spirituall and Eccleſiaſticall: It remaineth that we diſcuſſe and examine whether contrarie wiſe the Pope haue any temporall power, or can by his Spirituall power diſpoſe of temporall things. A
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8380:86"/>thing, I confeſſe, odious to ſome Princes, who can hardly brooke it, that you should meddle with their Crownes and Regalities, thinking their Crownes ſo faſt ſett on their Heads, that none but God can plucke them of, and imagining they holde their ſcepters ſo faſt, that none vnder God can wreſt them out of their hands. But yet this queſtion is odious only to ſuch as ſett little by the Churches Authoritie, or at leaſt, preferre the ſtate before Religion, and the Temporall aduancement of the Common wealth, before the Spirituall good of the Church: for otherwiſe, as guiltie malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours only crie out of the Princes lawes &amp; Tribunals, good ſubiects embrace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence them; ſo thoſe Princes only, whoſe conſciences accuſe them of ſome diſloyaltie towards the Church, or who deſire to preferre their owne wils before the Churches commandement, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Empire with encroaching on her Demaines, and to rule ſo independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as they may not be controlled; ſuch Princes (I ſay) can not abyde to heare of any Authoritie in the Pope, or Church, which may reſtraine them. Other Kings, who counte it their honour to be obedient Children of the Church, and who deſire not to raigne ouer their ſubiects, but ſo as God, and his Church may raigne ouer them, are content, that this opinion of the Popes authoritie be taught in ſchooles, and

And therfore of late his Catholike Maieſtie with three Bishops of his Counſell, and the Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine</hi> authorized the printing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of a booke of this ſubiect, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a learned Diuine <hi>Franciſcus Suarius,</hi> &amp; intituled, <hi>Defenſio fidei Catholicae &amp; Apoſtolicae, aduerſus Anglicanae ſectae errores, &amp;c.</hi> in which the Authoritie of the Pope in depoſing Princes, who by their tyrannie againſt the Church, make them ſelues vnworthy of their honourable roome and place, is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and learnedlie defended and prooued.</p>

               <p n="4">4. And ſo although CHRIST were, euen as man, a Temporall King, yet he not actually raigning him ſelf, it is not likelie that he should giue any ſuch authoritie to S. PETER, and the Pope his ſucceſſour. And although hee had actually raigned him ſelf, yet it is not neceſſarie that he should giue that Authoritie to S. PETER; for hee had alſo the power of Excellencie, by which he might command euen Infidels not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, and by which he inſtituted a Church, Sacraments, and a Prieſthood, which S. PETER, and the Pope his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour can not doe. Certes none can denie, but that CHRIST might haue giuen S. PETER ſupreme Iurisdiction ſpirituall ouer the Church without Temporall, becauſe as ſpirituall power is not neceſſarily annexed to the Temporall, as I haue proued in the former Chapter, ſo Temporall power is not neceſſarily ioyned to the ſpirituall; and therfore ſeing that neither the law of God,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8380:89"/>nor Nature, nor man giueth any ſuch Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Iurisdiction to the Chiefe Paſtour of the Church, why should either he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it, or we giue it him? eſpeciallie it being a thing verie inconuenient, and odious, that either the Church, or her Chiefe Paſtour should haue any ſuch Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power. For if it were ſo, that the Church or her ſupreme Paſtour had any ſuch ſoueraintie, it would deterre all Pagan Kings, and Princes from our Religion, fearing leaſt the Church by her abſolute Authoritie, might depriue them of their Kingdomes, Crownes, and Scepters at her pleaſure. And hence it is, that the Popes them ſelues confeſſe, that they haue no Imperiall, nor Kinglie Authoritie giuen them by CHRIST, but rather that theſe two powers are in diſtinct ſubiects.

But although the Pope and Chiefe Paſtour of the Church hath no direct Temporall power, but only in his owne Temporall Patrimonie and Kingdome, by which he may diſpoſe of Kingdomes, Crownes, and ſcepters, yet he hath a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power, which may directlie, and ordinarilie diſpoſe of ſpirituall matters, and indirectlie, and in ſome extraordinarie caſe, of the Temporall alſo; that is, when it shall be iudged neceſſarie for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the faith or Religion, or the Churches lawes, and right, or ſome other great and neceſſarie good. I ſay the Pope hath no direct power ouer Princes, for then he might limit their power, abrogate their lawes, and depoſe their perſons, at leaſt for ſome iuſt cauſe, though it did not concerne either faith, or the Churches right, or neceſſarie good, as the King can
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8380:90"/>deale with his Viceroy, and any of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; and then Princes should not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and independent, who yet, as aboue is declared, in Temporall matters, and ſo long as they exceede not the bounds of their authority, by commanding things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods law, or the Churches Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, acknowledg no Superiour in earth, neither Pope, nor Emperour, nor Common wealth. For as for the Emperour, all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who are not his Vaſſals (as the Kings of <hi>Spaine, England,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are not) as they acknowledge him Superiour in dignitie, and therfore will, and muſt giue him the precedence, wherſoeuer they meete, yet they are not ſubiect to him, nor bound to obey him, vnleſſe it be when the Pope, the Chiefe Paſtour, and hee the greateſt Prince in dignitie, shall thinke it neceſſarie that all Chriſtian Princes contribute, or concurre for the defence of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome againſt the Turke, or ſuch like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemie. As for the Pope I graunt that CHRIST gaue him no Temporall power at all (which aboue I haue prooued) for that Temporall power, which he hath in Italie, hee had not by Chriſts immediat graunt, but onlie by Conſtantines, and other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouts and Princes donation, which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſuppoſed, and confirmed alſo by Preſcription, and his ſubiects, yea all the Chriſtian worlds conſent, that part of Italie, which he poſſeſſeth, is as trulie appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Yea if the Pope were by the law of God a Temporall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine Prince ouer all the world, other Princes should holde of him; and CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTINES donation by which he made him Temporall Prince of <hi>Italie,</hi> had been no donation, but reſtitution. As for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, I haue aboue declared how it hath deſpoiled it ſelf of all authoritie, and by translating it to the King, is trulie a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and like a priuate perſon, and ſo hath no power ouer the King, vnles it be in caſe of intollerable Tyrannie, as aboue is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I ſay yet that the Pope hath an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect power ouer Kings euen in Temporall mattters, which power notwithſtanding is not Temporall but ſpirituall, nor any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct power from his ſpirituall ſupremacie, but euen the ſelf ſame: And therfore GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORIE <hi>the Seuenth</hi> in his depoſition of HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE <hi>the Fourth</hi> ſayth, that he <hi>depoſeth him by the power he hath from</hi> S.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8380:91"/>in excommunicating, interdicting and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spirituall offices, calling Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and deciding controuerſies of faith in them, in making Eccleſiaſticall lawes, in giuing Authoritie to preach, to miniſter Sacramentes, and ſuch like; yet when it is neceſſarie for the conſeruation of this power, or of the Church, or faith (of which it hath the Charge) that it diſpoſe of Temporall matters, it can do that alſo: and ſo the ſame ſpirituall Authoritie which directlie, and as it were <hi>ex prima intentione</hi> ordaineth and determineth of Spirituall matters, dealeth alſo with Temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, not abſolutelie, but as they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and neceſſary to the attaining of the Spirituall end, which is conſeruation of the Church and faith, and the ſoules falua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But becauſe this power doth not reſpect Temporall thinges principallie and for them ſelnes, but only ſecondarilie and as they are ordained to the conſeruation of the Spirituall good of the Church, it is ſayd indirectlie only, to reſpect Temporall matters: and for as much as it medleth not ordinarilie but in ſome extraordinary caſe with the ſaied Temporall matters, we may ſay that the Pope ordinarilie medleth with ſpirituall matters, and hath for his ordinarie glaiue and weapons, the Spirituall cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; but when they will not ſerue to defend the Churches neceſſarie right, then he may alſo vſe the Temporall ſword and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Par.</hi> 26.</note> AZARIAS the High Prieſt depoſed OZIAS for arrogating the Prieſts office: for although God immediately marked him with a leproſie, yet the high Prieſt after he was thus marked, had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from God by the Leuitical lawe,
<note place="margin">

Hence I inferre <hi>firſt,</hi> that the high Prieſt had in ſome caſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to diſpoſe of Temporall things, though they belonged to Kings. For cohabitation is a temporall thing, and yet the high Prieſt could depriue euen a King of the ſame: and if he may diſpoſe of this Temporall thing, why not of other Temporall things, though they be Kingdomes? <hi>Secondly,</hi> cohabitation or at leaſt power and right of cohabitation &amp; ſocietie, is eſſentiallie included in Kingly power, or at leaſt neceſſarille annexed vnto it: For a King is he that hath ſupreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to gouerne his ſubiects. And ſeing that gouernment neceſſarilie requireth, yea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth poſſibilitie, or right to cohabitate, and conuerſe with ſubiects (for how can he gouerne them, if he cannot conuerſe with them, or his officers?) if the King might by the Prieſt be depriued of all right to coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitate and conuerſe, he might be depriued alſo of his Kingdome. <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> OZIAS diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed the high Prieſt, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his reprehenſion and expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to the contrarie, did burne

Wherefore S. AVGVSTIN ſayth that it is <hi>grauius malum excommunicarià Sacerdotibus Dei, quàm ſi quis gladio feriretur, flammis abſorberetur, aut ferisobijceretur: It is a greater ill to be excommunicated by the Prieſts of God, then if a man were kild by the ſword, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by fire, or caſt vnto wild beaſts to be deuoured.</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:8380:102"/>And againe: <hi>Omnis Chriſtianus, qui à ſacerdotibus excommunicatur, Sathanae traditur &amp;c. Euery Chriſtian that is excommunicated by the Priests is deliuered vp to Satan. How ſo? Becauſe out of the Church is the Diuell, as within the Church Chriſt: and ſo hereby he is as it were deliuered vp to the diuell, who is ſeparated from Eccleſiaſticall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſocietie.</hi> Hence I deduce this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Chiefe Paſtour of the Church can excommunicate a Rebellious Prince, and by excommunicating him, depriue him of all the Spirituall Treaſures of the Church, as Sacraments, ſuffrages, merites, and ſatisfactions, yea he can cut him cleane from the Church, and deliuer him vp to Satan: <hi>ergo</hi> he can, when it is neceſſarie for the good of the Church, depriue him of Temporall goods, and euen of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I prooue the conſequence, becauſe he that can inflict the greater punishment, can inflict the leſſer; but it is a greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to be cut of from the Church, and to be depriued of her ſpirituall goods and graces, then to be depriued of Cities, countries, and Temporall Kiugdomes, <hi>ergo</hi> the Chiefe Paſtour, that can caſt a Prince out of the Church, can caſt him out of his Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I know our Aduerſaries will deny for all this my conſequence (as VViddrington doth) becauſe not alwayes he that can do more, can do leſſe, but onlie then, when the more and the leſſe are of the ſame
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8380:103"/>kinde and nature: As for example, he that can carrie fiftie pound weight, can carrie fiue and twenty pownd weight, and yet he that can diſcourſe and reaſon, which is more, can not flye, which is leſſe, becauſe reaſoning and flying are not of the ſame kinde and nature.

VVherfore ſeing that Temporall things are ordained to a ſpirituall end, (if not of their owne nature, yet by God his inſtitution, who hath ordained vs vnto a ſupernaturall end, as aboue I haue declared) and conſequentlie are ſubordinate, and as it were meanes to a further end, it may be ſayd by good conſequence, as S.

Neither will VViddringtons anſwere ſerue, to wit, that in this caſe they are to be directed and commanded by the Chiefe Paſtour for the conſeruation of the Church, but cannot be by him diſpoſed: becauſe the argument prooueth more, to wit, that if the Chiefe Paſtour can not only command in ſpirituall matters, which are greater, but alſo may diſpoſe of them, he may alſo diſpoſe of the Temporall, which are leſſer, they being in ſome caſe ſubordinate to the end of the Spirituall power, which is conſeruation of the Church, and faith, and procuration of eternall ſaluation.</p>

For although euerie one that can command, can not diſpoſe, yet Princes may. I graunt the Ghoſtlie Father can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Penitente to giue Almes, and the Penitent shall be bound vnder ſinne to obey; yet he shall not therfore looſe the proprietie, and dominion of thoſe his goods, which he should haue giuen in almes. Yea I graunt that the Prince, when he commandeth his ſubiects to contribute for his warres, or other neceſſities of the Realme, doth not alwaies by and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them of their dominion and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but yet I ſay, that as he can command Temporall things for the neceſſitie of the Realme, of which he hath charge; ſo he can by his abſolute power, called <hi>Dominium Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> when it is neceſſary for the Common wealth, not only command, but alſo take thoſe goods from them and depriue them of the ſame, as in many other caſes he alſo confiſcateth their goods and depriueth them of Dominion. VVherfore ſeing that the Pope is the ſupreame viſible and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Prince of the Church, he may, not only command Chriſtian Princes his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to vſe their Scepter, Authoritie, and

<note place="margin">The third Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> The third Argument shall be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Nature of the Church, as it is a Common wealth; for the Church is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Common wealth, not ſubordinate to any other, as the Kingdome is to the Chiefe Paſtour and Church: Now it is ſo, that euerie abſolute Common wealth, to wit, which is no part, nor is dependent of another, hath power not onlie to enact lawes for the ſubiects directions, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict punishment on them that are Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours, or perturbers of the Ciuill Peace at home, but alſo may make warre abroad both offenſiue and defenſiue for her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie conſeruation againſt another Common wealth (though otherwiſe not ſubiect, <hi>niſi ratione delicti</hi>) which shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade her rights, or offer any notable iniurie.

You will ſay that after she hath threatned Gods Iudgments, vſed her ſpirituall Armes and weapons, she hath no more to do, hauing no Temporall Armes to vſe, and ſo muſt commit all to God, But then ſay I, that CHRIST, who was incarnate, and liued and dyed for the Church, had not ſufficiently prouided for her defence. And they that ſay she can only haue acceſſe in that caſe to God, are like to thoſe Philoſophers who deny all power to ſecond cauſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſubſtantiall formes and effects, and make God the onlie Authour. But as theſe Philoſophers, are hiſſed out of the ſchooles, becauſe ſince God created all at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he doth nothing in Nature, but by ſecond cauſes: ſo I ſay, that VViddrington and others, who deny the Church all power to defend her ſelfe, are vnnaturall Children, yea mercileſſe and cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in remitting her to God only, who though he alwayes heare our praiers and petitions, yet doth not alwaies graunt them. VVherefore wee muſt finde out a ſword and an ordinarie ſecond cauſe which may
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:8380:112"/>in this caſe defend the Church, and this is no other then her Spirituall power, by which, as aboue is declared, she can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Temporall goods, and Kingdomes for the neceſſarie conſeruation of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good: For the better declaration wherof I demaund of our Proteſtantes in <hi>England,</hi> if his Maieſtie should turne Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and conſequently should put the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters out of office, perſecute them with ſword and fier, what would they doe?

<note place="margin">The Anſwer.</note> which yet wee ſee she alwayes hath not. I anſwer, that it is not neceſſarie that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8380:112"/>God should alwayes giue execution to matters: for the King and Common wealth cannot alwaies actually ſuppreſſe Rebelles and vanquish enemies; but yet as if the King or Common wealth had not authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to defend it ſelfe by defenſiue and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue weapons, neither he, nor the Common wealth were ſufficiently by God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture furnished or prouided for; ſo if Chriſt had not giuen his Church power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to defend and conſerue her ſelf by Temporall armes, when the ſpirituall glaiue will not ſerue, he had not prouided ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for her, neither had she had the Authoritie which is due to an abſolute Common wealth. And although God hath promiſed to protect his Church to the end, (as he promiſed to defend the Synagogue, and to continue the Kingdome to Dauids poſteritie) yet he vſeth ſecond cauſes for the execution and performance of his ſayed promiſe. And therfore as not withſtanding his promiſe, the Iewes and Dauid vſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane meanes, as warres, and ſuch like, for their conſeruation; ſo may the Church when her ſpirituall power is contemned.</p>

But as in other thinges, Widdrington to holde vp the cauſe whoſe defence he hath vndertaken, is forced to helpe him ſelfe with the worſt opinions, and to ſeeke authoritie from the obſcureſt Authours, and theſe of the leaſt credit; So dealeth he in this: for he is not ignorant, that whatſoeuer ſome one, or two Authours may ſay, that all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Diuines miſlike them in this, and counte it ſtraunge, yea and abſurde, to ſay that all the penall lawes of the Church, which preſcribe Temporall mulctes related in the Canon law, and in Councelles; should
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8380:120"/>haue theire force not from the Councelles and Paſtours, but from Kinges and Princes. For although they confeſſe, that Princes gaue to the Pope his Temporall Demaines, and conſequentlie Temporall and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Authoritie within the limites of the ſame; yet in what meeting of Princes, in what Councell, did euer Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to giue the Pope Temporall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie through out the whole Church? And in the laſt Generall Councell of Trent in which diuerſe Temporall penalties are decreed, what mention is there of the Princes donation of Authoritie to the Councell? Princes and Emperours by them ſelues or their Legates are preſent at the Councell to protect the Fathers, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them for execution of theire lawes, but that they euer gaue authoritie to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to enact any Temporall law, or that the Fathers of the Councell and the Chiefe Paſtour of the Church demaunded licence and Authoritie of the Emperour or Princes to make ſuch lawes, who euer read? who euer heard? And why could not the Princes, why would not they them ſelues enact ſuch lawes in their owne name (as ſometimes they haue don againſt Heretickes) that being a thinge more honourable for them and leſſe daungerous to them, ſeing that by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Popes and Bishops to doe it, they might derogate to their owne authoritie and giue
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8380:120"/>occaſion to them to preſcribe againſt them and to do it not in the Princes but in their owne name and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? And when did WIDDRINGTON heare that any good Chriſtians appealed from the Church and Pope in theſe lawes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Princes as to their higheſt Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours? when did they reiect any of theſe lawes till they had informed them ſelues that they were made not by the Churches but by the Princes authoritie? Certes WIDDRINGTON in this openeth a wide gap for Heretickes and all contemners of the Churches authoritie. And what may he not defend if he be permitted to vſe this libertie and audacitie? As for his Authours we shall ſee hereafter in the enſewing thirteenth Chapter, how many they are and of what Authoritie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherfore my Argument shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede as it began in this manner: The Pope by VViddrington can make a Decree to depoſe inferiour Temporall Lordes <hi>ergo</hi> Supreame Princes, they as Chriſtians being as ſubiect te the Church by Baptiſme (as aboue is shewed in the 5. Chapter num. 4.5.6.) as much as the loweſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, though in that they are abſolute Princes they haue no Superiour but God in Temporall Authoritie. To ſay that Pope INNOCENT made this Decree of his own head, is but to shew great ignorance, for in Generall Councels Popes
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8380:121"/>ſpeake <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> and as publick, not priuate perſons; and what they decree, is With the common conſent of all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or the moſt part; elſe if the Pope should do all of his owne head, in vaine should he aſſemble Generall Councels. But that all the Councell and Chriſtian world conſented to this decree, it is cleare enough, for that no mention is made of any variance betwixt the Pope, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in this matter. To ſay that the true Councell of Laterane is not extant, or that the Canons extant were compiled only by INNOCENTIVS, becauſe in this Councell, the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Laterane</hi> (though not this, but another) is cited and alleadged, are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable euaſions, that they merit not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, and are verie ſuffieientlie reiected by the booke called <hi>Diſcuſsio decreti Magni Concilij Lateranenſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. One thinge there is bearing more shew, which our Aduerſaries might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage, to wit, that if this Councell did in expreſſe tearmes define that the Pope hath power to depoſe Princes, they would then yeeld, becauſe what a Generall Councell with the Pope defineth directly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, is a mattet of faith, and it is hereſie to gainſay it. But ſeing that all thinges ſpoken, or written in a Councell are not matters of faith, (for, as Diuines common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſay, the reaſons which the Councell bringeth for confirmation of her decree,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:8380:121"/>and thoſe things which are ſpoken inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie,

               <p n="6">6. But who ſo pleaſeth to conſider this decree well, and without all paſſion, or partiall affection, muſt needs confeſſe, that this decree ought to be of verie great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: for firſt the Pope and Councell ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at leaſt that the pope can depoſe Princes, elſe they would neuer haue made ſuch a Decree, and conſequentlie this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree argueth that the Pope and all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Princes, and Legates preſent, were of that opinion, which no doubt, they being ſo many and ſo learned, muſt needs beare a great ſway amongſt all good Chriſtians; for what they thought, all the Chriſtian world, at leaſt for the moſt part, thought, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing and approouing this Councell. But widdringto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will ſay, that he will not denie, but that they all thought ſo piouslie, and probablie, yet becauſe they defined not in expreſſe tearmes that the Pope can depoſe Princes, he will not beleeue it. A peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie Anſwer certainlie, and wherin (to ſay no more) the Anſwerer shall shew him
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8380:122"/>ſelfe verie ſlow and hard of beleefe, and to hardie alſo, who blusheth not to gainſay ſo many learned and godlie Prelates, and whome ſo many graue countenances and Iudgements can not moue.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But I will deale yet another Way, and out of the ſelfe ſame decree. Although the Pope and Councell in the alleaged decree do not expreſlie define that Popes can vpon iuſt cauſe depoſe Princes, yet it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth that they, nor onlie probablie, but verilie, and aſſuredlie thought he could, elſe to haue grounded ſo odious a decree, and iniurious alſo (if the Pope haue not Authoritie) vpon a probable opinion, had bene great rashneſſe. For the Councell had expoſed therby (if the opinion had not bene ſuppoſed moſt aſſured) the King and Common wealth, yea and ſometimes the whole Church to vprores, garboiles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious warres, and ſuch like: And warre should haue bene iuſt alſo on both ſides: For the ſubiects might haue refuſed to obey the depoſed Prince, as being freed by a Generall Councels authoritie from all obligation to him, and being warranted by the ſame Councell, that now he is no more their King, but an vſurper and Inuader, againſt whom euerie particuler man hath <hi>iuſtum bellum; iuſt warre.</hi> And ſo as if a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Prince should vniuſtlie inuade <hi>France</hi> without iuſt title or wrong receiued, euerie Frenchman might reſiſt him, if he could,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8380:122"/>becauſe he hauing no Title, all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and euerie particuler member hath iuſt warre againſt him; ſo if a Prince depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſiſt in gouernment, he is according to the Popes and Councels opinion (which <hi>VViddrington</hi> confeſſeth to be probable) an vſurper and inuader, and conſequentlie euerie one of his former ſubiects hath iuſt warre againſt him,

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:8380:123"/>was temerarious and rash to build ſo peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a Decree vpon no aſſured, but only probable opinion; or she thought aſſuredly that the Pope had ſuch Authoritie; and then euerie obedient Child of the Church should rather follow hers, then <hi>Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> and ſome few his companions opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

For <hi>Firſt,</hi> if the Pope could command an vnlawfull thing, he should command vice for vertue, and might forbid vertue as vnlawfull: whence should follow that the Church (which muſt obey her Chiefe Paſtour) should erre in a matter neceſſarie to ſaluation; for she should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace vice for vertue, and imbracinge that, should be no more <hi>Holie.</hi> Yea then the Church should erre in a matter of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the Pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vice for vertue, the Church, which muſt giue eare to her Chiefe Paſtour, should embrace it as lawfull, and conſequentlie should embrace a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith; for, as it is againſt faith to ſay or thinke that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not reallie in the Bleſſed Sacrament, ſo is it to ſay or thinke that vice is vertue: which yet the Chiefe Paſtour should teach in commanding, and the Church should beleeue in embracing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8380:125"/>and obſeruing? Whence I inferre that the former decree of the <hi>Councell</hi> is a matter of faith, and neceſſarily to be beleeued. For by this decree, the Pope and <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> do abſolue the ſubiects from obedience and fidelitie by a Generall Decree, &amp; do depoſe the Prince from his Kingdome, which if it were vniuſt (as it muſt needs be, if the Pope had no Authoritie) the Pope and Councell should erre in a matter againſt faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Catholick faith teacheth, that vertue is good, vice is euill and vnlawfull; &amp; yet if this decree of depoſition of the Prince and abſolution of his ſubiects from their fidelitie were againſt iuſtice, the Church, which muſt obey her Chiefe Paſtour, should be bound to thinke iniuſtice to be iuſtice, &amp; vice to be vertue, which is againſt faith. And therfore if <hi>VViddrington,</hi> notwitſtanding this decree, will obſtinate lie holde, that the Pope cannot depoſe a Prince, or free his ſubiects from their fidelitie and alleageance, he muſt graunt, that either the Pope with the Councell commandeth againſt faith, or that hee diſobeyeth againſt faith, not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that to be iuſt, which the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth with a Generall Councell.

Secondlie he can for a crime merelie ſpirituall, as if the nation of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire should become hereticall or should transferre it ſelfe to an other ſecte relinquishing the Chriſtian ſecte, for this, the Pope might depriue that nation of Imperiall dignitie, and ſo transferre it to an other nation.

But it is well knowne to many, that <hi>Mr. Blacwell</hi> whileſt he was at libertie, was ſo Zealous for
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:8380:145"/>the Popes Authoritie depoſing, that he thought it a matter of faith. And I haue heard a Catholicke Gentleman named, who viſiting <hi>M. Blacwell</hi> in Priſon, ſayd vnto him: <hi>did not you M. Blacwell, heretofore tell me that the oath of allegeance was in no caſe lawfull?</hi> And <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> him ſelfe knoweth that in a certaine conference betwixt the Archprieſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts at which, <hi>VViddrington</hi> him ſelfe was preſent, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Archprieſt ſayd he thought the Pope had Authoritie to depoſe a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, but yet, matters ſtanding as they did, he could not lawfullie exerciſe it. Yea in that conference alſo WIDDRINGTON him ſelfe was ZEALOVS for this the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, though after his impriſonment, and after his Chiefe Paſtours Breues which should haue confirmed him, he hath chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his opinion. Let then the Reader iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of what Authoritie the wordes of a fearfull olde man then Priſoner, and ſtraightlie examined, are, he eſpeciallie hauing auerred the contrarie when he was at libertie? what elſe can hence be gathered, then that rather out of feare then Iudgement, he allowed the oath when he was in his Aduerſaries handes, of whom otherwiſe he expected all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. And perchaunce WIDDRINGTON him ſelfe, who before his impriſonement was ſo Zealous for the Popes authoritie, and againſt the oath, hath not now ſo much chaunged his minde as his tounge, nor
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:8380:146"/>ſpeaketh not ſo much out of iudgement and opinion as out of feare or fainteneſſe of harte. And now that he hath begun, he thinkes he muſt go forward.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Laſtely he alleageth in all his bookes the 13. Reuerend Prieſtes, thinking by their Authoritie and credit (for they were graue and learned men, conſtant confeſſours, and twoe of them glorious martirs) to grace and credit his opinion. But becauſe they are able enough to anſwer for them ſelues, I will not entermeddle my ſelfe in other mens matters, onlie in a worde or two I will anſwer what in effect I thinke they might anſwer, and what I haue heard ſome of them anſwer. And this I thought good to do for 2. reaſones: firſt for the reſpect and loue I beare to them, they being of my coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and principall men of the English Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, which ſo conſtantlie hath borne the brunt of a longe perſecution, that it may be an example to all other Clergies, and a mirrout to furure ages. Secondly leaſt I should do them iniurie: For if I anſwering to <hi>VViddringtons</hi> other Authours, should ſay nothing of theſe by <hi>VViddrington</hi> ſo often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, I might giue occaſion to the world to thinke, that I paſſed theſe with ſilence becauſe they were ſo manifeſt fautours of <hi>VViddringtons</hi> opinion, as I could not tell what to ſay in their defence. I anſwer <hi>Firſt</hi> that this their proteſtation was by them made before the Popes Breues came forth, that is
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8380:146"/>Anno 1603. and therfore bee it that then they were of that opinion; yet ſeing that ſince the <hi>Breues</hi> were published, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and proteſt the contrarie, as <hi>VViddring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> well knoweth, and that one of them yet liuing, whileſt he was in priſon, ſayd he would not take the oath for the Bishopricke of London, and two others of them (<hi>Mr. Drurie</hi> and <hi>Mr. Cadwallader</hi>) ſuffred death ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they would take the oath; <hi>VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> hath no more reaſon to alleage them now for the oath, then I may haue to alleage now <hi>VViddrington</hi> againſt the oath, becauſe once he ſtood againſt it. If WIDDRING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON ſay they should not haue chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged their opinion; I muſt tell him, that they had more reaſon to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their opinion vpon their Chiefe Paſtours commandement, then <hi>VViddrington</hi> hath to chaunge his opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Chiefe Paſtours commandement.

The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe 13. Reuerend Prieſtes eaſilie induced to beleeue that which they ſo much deſired, and fearefull not to giue way to ſo great a good pretended to English Catholickes, were content to make that Proteſtation which <hi>Widdrington</hi> ſetteth downe,

So in the ſame Chapter, he confeſſeth, that the Archprieſt hath power to take from the Prieſtes, who holde the oath to be lawfull, their faculties: and yet if he should, he would ſay they were not taken away, not for wante of power, but for want of iuſt cauſe. So Father <hi>Perſonnes</hi> alleaged by <hi>Widdrington,</hi> ſayth:
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Si enim quaeſtio eſset de facto &amp;c. for if the queſtion were of facte</hi> (as this is of the 13. Ptieſtes) <hi>to wit whether the Pope in this, or that caſe can depoſe or excommunicate this, or that Prince, vpon theſe or theſe cauſes, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the former Popes haue done rightin this, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then ſome of theſe reaſons which you affirme are alleaged by your frindes, might be admitted into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether it would be to aedification or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, whether it would bringe with it commoditie or diſcommoditie, whether it would be profitable or hurtfull, or whether there were cauſes ſufficient or not (for no man defendeth, that the Pope can depoſe without iuſt cauſe) or whether due admonition (of which in your letters there is mention) hath been made.</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:8380:148"/>Thirdlie ſuppoſe the ſentence of <hi>Pius Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> where valid and iuſt (as the contrarie is not eaſilie to be thought of a man of ſuch Authoritie and ſanctitie) and conſequentlie that the Queene was iuſtlie and trulie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: yet the 13. Prieſtes might promiſſe to obey her in Temporall and lawfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe they might thinke, that the Queene would notwithſtanding the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſtill raigne and gouerne, and would perſecute with loſſe of goods, libertie, and liues all thoſe, that would not obey her; and ſeing that ſuch domages excuſe from the ſentence of excommunication, and giue leaue to communicate with the Prince excommunicated, and to obey him in all lawfull matters; the 13. Prieſtes ſuppoſing otherwiſe the daunger of incurring theſe domages, might promiſſe obedience to the Queene in all lawfull matters. Wherefore Diuines &amp; Caſuiſts haue in theſe two verſes comprehended all the thinges which excuſe from excommunication, and make commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the excommunicat perſons lawfull:
<q>
                     <l>Haec Anathema quidem faciunt ne poſsit obeſſe:</l>
                     <l>Vtile, lex, humile, res ignorata, neceſſe.</l>
                  </q> Thirdly and laſtly I anſwer, that although the ſentence of excommunication and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt Queene ELIZABETH were valid, and conſequentlie she trulie depoſed and depriued of all Regall Authoritie, yet the 13. Prieſtes at the time when they made
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8380:148"/>that their Proteſtation might acknowledge Queene ELIZABETH to be their lawfull Queene, and to haue as full Authoritie as any her predeceſſours had: becauſe that ſentence of PIVS QVINTVS might at that time be abrogated, and of no force, and ſo ceaſe to bind, and conſequentlie the Prieſtes might acknowledge, that then she had as full power as she had before the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and as much right and Authoritie as any of her Predeceſſours. And indeede that PIVS QVINTVS ſentence did at that time ceaſe to binde, it may be gathered by this, that thirtie three yeares had paſſed from her depoſition vnto the time in which theſe 13. Prieſts made their Proteſtation: all which time as well Catholickes as Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts obeyed her as Queene, the Popes then raigning knowing, and not reclayming, and conſequentlie conſenting: which conſent of the ſubiectes of England and Popes of Rome, was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to abrogate the former ſentence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie to putte Queene ELIZABETH in the ſame eſtate she was in before the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And that this tacit conſent is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to abrogat either poſitiue law or ſentence, I prooue by <hi>Vaſq.</hi> wordes,

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing that in <hi>England</hi> the ſentence of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> pronounced againſt Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> was not obſerued for three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares before the thirteene Prieſts Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and that all that while euen the Catholickes obeyed her as Queene, the Popes knowing and not contradicting, yea ſome of them (as I haue heard of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the 13. and <hi>Clement</hi> the 8.) expreſſelie approouing, it followeth that at the time of the 13. Prieſts Proteſtation, the ſentence of depoſition by contrarie vſe and cuſtome, was abrogated, and ſo Queene ELIZABETH was at that time in the ſame ſtate she was in before the ſentence, and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie might be acknowledged for true Queene, and to haue as full power, and Authoritie, as any of her Predeceſſours. But becauſe <hi>widdrington</hi> may alleage, that theſe 13. reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Prieſts not o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie promiſed that they would acknowledge Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> notwithſtanding any ſentence alreadie pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced; but alſo <hi>notwitſtanding any Authoritie, or any Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication whatſoeuer, either denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, or to be denounced, to yeeld vnto her Maieſtie all obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall cauſes,</hi> I anſwer that the 13.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8380:149"/>Reuerend Prieſts might acknowledge in the Pope authoritie to depoſe the Queene, and yet promiſe her obedience in Lawfull thinges, ſuppoſing the ſentence would be inualid for ſome of the aforeſayd cauſes, and not for want of authoritie. Againe, they might thinke that if the Queene would giue for herafter libertie of Conſcience, as was pretended, and continue the ſame, as the 13. Prieſts might hope, the Pope should haue no cauſe to Excommunicate or depoſe her, and therfore would not, or if he would, they might imagine that in that caſe he could not iuſtlie, nor without great iniurie to the Catholickes of England, proceede ſo againſt her, that, being to prouoke her to a new perſecution; and ſo the 13. Reuerend Prieſtes might thinke them ſelues not bound to obey in that caſe the Popes ſentence and commaundement, it being vniuſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie, <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> they might promiſe, notwithſtanding any ſentence to be denounced, to obey the Queene in all Temporall and lawfull cauſes, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and aſſiſt her. If <hi>VViddrington</hi> should here obiect, that if the 13. Prieſts might promiſe to acknowledge and obey Queen Elizabeth, notwithſtanding any ſentence to be pronounced, ſuppoſing the ſentence would be vniuſt: why may not the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Subiect of England, take the oath of pretended alleageance, and ſweare that the Pope can not depoſe the King, and that if
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:8380:150"/>he should, he would ſtill acknowledge and obey him, ſuppoſing the ſentence would be vniuſt? I anſwer him that the caſe is not like; becauſe in the oath the queſtion is <hi>de iure</hi> not <hi>de facto,</hi> and therfore the Subiect ſweareth abſolutlie, that the Pope hath <hi>not any power or Authoritie to depoſe the King, and that notwithſtanding any ſentence of Excommunication or depriuation made or graunted, or to be made or graunted against the ſayd King, or any abſolution of the ſayd ſubiectes from their obedience, he will beare true fayth and true allegeance to his Maieſtie.</hi> And ſeing that the Pope hath ſuch Authoritie to depoſe a Prince, as here I ſuppoſe, it is periurie at leaſt to ſweare abſolutlie that he hath no ſuch Authoritie ouer the King, and it is iniurie to the Pope. But the 13. Prieſts ſpeake <hi>de facto</hi> not <hi>de iure,</hi> and therfore they proteſt not that the Pope hath no ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but promiſe what they would doe <hi>de ſacto,</hi> notwithſtanding any his Authoritie, that is, that not withſtanding the Popes Authoritie and ſentence, (ſo libertie of Conſcience were graunted to all English Catholickes as they were borne in hand it should) they would ſtill acknowledge and obey the Queene, ſuppoſing in that caſe, the ſentence would be vniuſt, and ſo of no force to bynd in conſcience. Wherfore ſeing that theſe 13. Reuerend Prieſtes might make their Proteſtation of acknowledging and obeying Q. ELIZABETH, not for that they thought the Pope could not depoſe her,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:8380:150"/>but for other reaſons alleaged: why should then <hi>VViddrington</hi> take them in the worſt ſence? why should he bringe them ſo oft on the ſtage? why should he thinke to grace his opinion by their grauitie, learning, and Authoritie, he knowing, whatſoeuer they thought of the Popes Authoritie in depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, before the Popes Breues came forth (as they proteſt they neuer thought as <hi>VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> doth) that when he began to impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne this the Popes Authoritie, and againſt his Chiefe Paſtours commaundement to defend the oath, they proteſted in priuat and publicke the contrarie. And ſo <hi>VViddrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gton</hi> may aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forgiueneſſe by publicke writing, whom he hath publickelie and yet wrongefullie ſought to defame.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Here becauſe I would not paſſe my limittes of breuitie which I intended in this booke, I thought to haue concluded this Chapter. But after I had examined theſe Authours, yea after that the Printer was come to this Chapter, I came to the ſight of <hi>VViddringtons Supplication</hi> and <hi>Appendix</hi> ioyned to it, which before I had nor ſeene: for that Catholickes making a ſcruple ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to read, or to keepe bookes forbidden by the Chiefe Paſtour, and Superiours being vigilant (and worthilie) to ſuppreſſe ſuch bookes, it is hard in Catholicke countries to meete with any of <hi>VViddringtons</hi> bookes, two of them being expreſſelie condemned, and all his later bookes being almoſt but
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:8380:151"/>repetitions of the former: yet hauing hitte vpon this booke, I was deſirous to ſee with what dexteritie he defended theſe authours againſt <hi>Schulckennius.</hi> And I find that he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to acknowledge two of them, to wit <hi>Dantes</hi> and <hi>Ocham,</hi>

But I onlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that by</hi> IOHN AZORIVS, <hi>they were alleaged for that opinion.</hi> And yet who could thinke otherwiſe, then that he had produced them for his Authours, ſeing that after the firſt opinion of <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> and others which holdeth that the Chiefe Paſtour may in ſome caſe diſpoſe of Temporalities and Regalities, he ſetteth downe the ſecond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of thoſe who holde that the Chiefe Paſtour in no caſe, by no Authoritie, either directlie or indirectlie, hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Prince; and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Authours of this ſecond opinion, which he him ſelfe Embraceth, he ſayth: <hi>Hanc ſententiam (vt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert Ioannes Azorius, Societatis Ieſu Theologus) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur Gulielmus Occamus, Ioannes Pariſienſis, Dantes, Aligerius, Iacobus Almainus &amp;c.

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:8380:151"/>for his Authours, though out of <hi>Azorius,</hi> as well as the other Authours. But it ſeemeth he is loath altogether to refuſe theſe two Authours, and therefore he ſayth, <hi>Azorius</hi> maketh <hi>Occham</hi> a Claſſicall Authour, and <hi>Gabriell</hi> and the <hi>Nominalles</hi> follow him as the Prince of the <hi>Nominalles,</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> do ofte alleage him for theire opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but what doth all this prooue, but onlie that <hi>Occham</hi> in reſpect of his skille in Logicke and Philoſophie and Schoole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, was a principall Doctour amongſt the Nominalles, and in that reſpect is often alleaged by Catholicke Doctours? yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, euen <hi>Azorius, Suarez,</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> do condemne Occhams bookes, which <hi>VViddrington</hi> ſo eſteemeth, to wit thoſe which he wrote againſt the Pope, and his Authoritie. And touching <hi>Dantes,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>Trithemius</hi> affirmed that <hi>Dantes</hi> was moſt ſtudious in Holie Scriptures. But be it that <hi>Dantes</hi> after Poetrie and Humanitie ſtudied Scriptures, yet he preſuming to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Scriptures without groundes in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as <hi>Eraſmus, Laurentius Valla,</hi> and others did, might fall into erroures as well as they. and certainlie who ſo pleaſeth to reade his <hi>Monarchie</hi> shall perceaue in it more Poetrie, Poeticall inuentions, and ſlight and ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Philoſophie, then ſolid Diuinitie. Whereas he reiecteth <hi>Bartolus</hi> cenſure of <hi>Dantes,</hi> as I haue no leiſure, ſo will I not wrangle with him about that. This shall
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:8380:152"/>ſuffice me, that both of theſe two Authours are cenſured in the <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> ſet forth by Authoritie of the Councell of Trent and diuerſe Popes. And although Widdrington ſayth, that the compilers of the <hi>Index are not the Catholicke Church,</hi> and that he knoweth not for what cauſe diuerſe bookes in the <hi>Index</hi> are condemned, wherin he sheweth little reſpect to Superiours; yet at leaſt thoſe bookes, which are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the <hi>Index,</hi> can be no leſſe then ſcandalous, and the Authours no leſſe then infamous, and ſo no fit witneſſes, nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours to make an opinion probable. So that let Widdrington chooſe what he will. Either he will haue theſe Authours, or he will not; if he will, they can giue no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his opinion, they hauing none them ſelfes; if he will not, he hath two Authours fewer, and by the ſame reaſon may reiect diuerſe others, yea all the other Authours: and ſo, <hi>vae ſoli,</hi> woe to him that ſtandeth poſt alone.

And therfore as Popes take this doctrine in good parte, ſo ought Princes not to take it ſo haynouſly that we affirme, that in caſe of intolerable tyrannie againſt the Church, the Pope may depoſe them: But rather as they are content ſo to beare rule ouer their ſubiects, as they will permitt God to beare rule ouer them; ſo they should alſo be content to ſubiect them ſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Kingdomes, Crownes, and ſcepters to Chriſt and his Kingdome, that raigning vnder him here for a time, they may raigne with him hereafter for euer.</p>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Secondlie</hi> the Prince or Magiſtrate can not iuſtly vexe ſubiects, nor trouble their conſciences with it, but only for his own ſecuritie: but this Oath is ſo farre from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the King, that rather it expoſeth him to greater daunger; <hi>ergo</hi> to ſecure him ſelfe, the King cannot iuſtlie propoſe this Oath. That this Oath cannot ſecure the King, it is manifeſt, becauſe the moſt that take this Oath, take it againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and not ſo much out of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as for feare; yea they thinke they do ill in taking it, and conſequently they thinke they are not bound to obſerue the ſame, for to ſweare to do an euill thing, and after to fulfill the Oath, is a double ſinne,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8380:159"/>one in ſwearing, another in fulfilling. An example is in <hi>Herod,</hi> who ſinned in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by a ſolemne Oath, that he would graunt his Daughter what ſoeuer she asked, and as he was bound not to ſtand to ſuch a rash oath, ſo he ſinned againe in fulfilling it. And Widdrington requireth onlie, that we should ſweare, that we thinke it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Pope can not depoſe a Prince, which opinion probable, and conſequentlie fearfull (for a probable opinion is alwayes ioyned <hi>cis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And ſo the King after this Oath is no more ſecure then before, becauſe the Catholicks, who take this Oath againſt their conſcience, know that they are not bound to keepe their oath. And they who ſweare onlie that they thinke it probable that the Pope can depoſe, ſweare with feare and without any certaine aſſent, and ſo may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that opinion which they holde then, in to the contrarie. Yea the Prince thereby bringeth him ſelf into greater daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For by ſo vnwonted &amp; odious an Oath, ſo contrarie to his ſubiectes conſciences, he cannot but make him ſelf odious, which how dangerous it is,

CLAVDIVS the Emperour neuer went to a Banket, but he enuironed the table with

And what a ſtrong Guarde, what armies can do to defend a Prince that is hated, we haue ſeene by the example of the two HENRIES, the <hi>Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> wherof the <hi>Firſt</hi> was killed by a ſillie Fryat, the other by a poore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, in the middeſt of their Armies, And ſo the firſt condition required to propoſe this Oath, which is Iudgement, that dictateth that an oath is neither to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed nor taken without iuſt cauſe, is wanting.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Veritie</hi> alſo, which is the ſecond companion of an oath, is here deficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is falſe that the Pope can not depoſe Princes, as I haue prooued by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo to ſweare it, were to ſweare a falſitie, and conſequently the propoſer of this Oath obſerueth not the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is <hi>Veritie,</hi> without the which all oathes are periurie, and ſo neither to be propoſed, not taken.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The third condition is alſo wanting, becauſe if it be true that the Pope hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to depoſe Princes (as I haue prooued) it is againſt <hi>Iustice</hi> to denie him this authoritie, and conſequently to ſweare
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8380:160"/>the denyall.

I will not ſtand much with WID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRINGTON about this clauſe, becauſe all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks will acknowledge his Maieſtie that now is, for their Prince and King, and will ſweare alſo fidelitie vnto him in all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters; and this Oath hath bene offered by the Catholicks in an Epiſtle they
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8380:161"/>wrote to his Maieſtie; which others alſo haue offered, and for better notice and in argument of their true meaninge published their offer in print. This then is one reaſon which maketh Catholicks to ſuſpect, that in this Oath couertlie is intended a denyall of the Popes ſpirituall ſupremacie. For if the Prince, and his Magiſtrate intended only Ciuill and Temporall Alleageance, why did they not propoſe this Oath in the ordinarie tenour and termes of a Ciuill oath, with which the former Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and all Catholick Kinges of other Countries euen to this day content them ſelues? Why bring they in the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, which other Princes leaue out? But they knew that Catholicks would neuer haue refuſed ſuch an oath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to trouble, and engage their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to haue thereby ſome pretence to ſeaze vpon their liuings and goods, and to vexe their perſons, they deuiſed this Oath. Which their manner of proceeding may make Catholicks iuſtlie ſuſpect that ſome thing is intended, to which in conſcience they cannot agree, and conſequentlie (oathes, conſcience, and Religion being ſo nice and daungerous matters) if there were no other reaſon then this,

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:8380:162"/>ſwearing that our ſupreame Lord King IAMES is true, and lawfull King, we do not ſweare that he is Soueraigne or Supreame Lord, but only that he, who is ſo ſtiled, is our Prince and King, which no English Catholicke will refuſe to ſweare. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Catholicks haue good cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all things in this vnwonted Oath, it being not the ordinarie Oath of Alleagea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which the Kings in other Countries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and wherewith the Kings of England contented them ſelues, till they began to ſeuer them ſelues from the true Catholicke Romane Church (for true Catholicke and Romane euer went together) and to banish out of their Realme all Papall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as an enemie to their ſtate, which other Princes do retaine, and euer haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced and maintained as the Chiefe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Kingdoms. And that which augmenteth the ſuſpition is, for that his Maieſtie him ſelfe ſeemeth to make doubt of this Oath; and ſo it ſeemeth daungerous either for the Magiſtrate to propoſe it, or the ſubiects to receaue it.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:8380:168"/>it is cleare and manifeſt, that he may certainlie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and ſweare, that the Pope hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to committe open iniustice; and that in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vncertaine, and diſputable caſe the condition of the poſſeſſour is to be preferred.</hi> But although <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> maketh great accounte of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, yet it will be found defectiue. For <hi>firſt VViddrington</hi> is not ignorant, that the power and exerciſe of the power are two thinges, which alſo may be ſeparated: for we haue the power of ſeeing when we ſleepe, but not the exerciſe of it; &amp; we haue the power of walking when we repoſe our ſelues on our bedde, and yet then we walke not. And ſo the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating and depoſing is one thing, and the exerciſe of it is an other; and therfore the Bishop may haue power to excommunicate, and yet not exerciſe that power; and the Pope may haue power to depoſe, although he do not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie depoſe any. Secondly WIDDRIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GTON knoweth, that a man may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the power to do a thing <hi>validlie,</hi> that is, ſo as the thing donne shall ſtand in force, and yet not <hi>lawfullie,</hi> that is, with out ſinne. As for example, the Prelate or Soueraigne Prince, who haue Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to diſpenſe in poſitiue lawes ſubiect to their Authoritie, if they diſpenſe with out iuſt cauſe, the diſpenſation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the probable opinion of diuerſe Diuines, is <hi>valid</hi> and of force, and freeth the

Wherefore ſeing that in this <hi>ſecond clauſe</hi> we are to ſweare that the Pope <hi>hath no power or Authoritie to depoſe the King, or to diſpoſe of his maieſties Kingdomes or
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:8380:169"/>Dominions, &amp;c.</hi> Although perchaunce he can not now, as thinges ſtand, lawfullie exerciſe his power in depoſing an abſolute Prince, becauſe much more hurt then good might come of it; yet if it be probable, that the Pope hath power to depoſe (as Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton confeſſeth it is probable) I demaunde of Widdrington, how he can ſweare reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie that the Pope hath no ſuch authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he being not ignorant that many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men holde it, and that more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he hath? And ſo for all this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, my former Argument is in force. wherfore although it were but probable, that the Pope hath authoritie to depoſe a Prince, and that conſequentlie he could not actuallie without iniuſtice depoſe him (the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of the Poſſeſſour being to be preferred) yet ſeing that the power is one thinge, &amp; the exerciſe an other, and that it is at leaſt probable that the Pope hath power to depoſe, how can WIDDRINGTON, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing this probabilitie, ſweare abſolutelie that the Pope hath no authoritie to depoſe? As for example, one is in poſſeſſion of a Tenement and hath probable right, an other hath alſo probable right to it, but without poſſeſſion, and ſo can not iuſtlie diſpoſſeſſe, becauſe <hi>in the like defaulte or cauſe,

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:8380:170"/>yet he could not ſweare, that he hath no right to the Tenement, if he know that he hath probable right. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if it were but probable, that the Pope can depoſe, one might ſweare that he cannot exerciſe this power iuſtlie, becauſe <hi>melior eſt conditio Principis poſſidentis,</hi> yet he could not ſweare (as in this clauſe he is commaunded) that the Pope hath no power nor right to depoſe a Prince. For as a man may haue probable right to a Tenement, and yet can not put him out of poſſeſſion who alſo hath probable right, becauſe poſſeſſion hindereth: ſo the Pope might haue probable authoritie to depoſe, yet could not actuallie depoſe a Prince, becauſe his poſſeſſion hindereth. Laſtelie by as many Arguments, as I haue deduced out of Scriptures, Councelles, The ologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call principles, and practiſe of holy Popes, to prooue that the Pope can in ſome caſes depoſe a Prince, I haue alſo prooued WIDDRINGTONS opinion improbable. And although three or foure Authours, or as many as VVIDDRINGTON alleageth may make an opinion probable,

And therfore though ſome few Doctours holde with <hi>VViddrington,</hi> or rather he with them; yet ſeing that the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:8380:170"/>reſt of the Doctours in number, learning, and ſanctitie farre excelling, do ſtand againſt his opinion; that his Authours either holde againſt him, or are cenſured by the Church; that the Decrees of Councelles and facts of Popes do condemne him, his Authours, and his opinion; and that latelie his Chiefe Paſtours ſentence hath pronounced, that the oath of <hi>Alleageance containeth thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to faith and ſaluation:</hi> in which wordes, no doubt WIDDRINGTONS opinion, the principall ſubiect of the oath is deepelie taxed; how can WIDDRINGTONS opinion be probable? and if his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not probable, the contrarie opinion which holdeth, that the Pope can depoſe a Prince, muſt be more then probable, and no leſſe then certaine, as beſides other Arguments the <hi>Lateran De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> which otherwiſe should be vniuſt, doth demonſtrate: whence followeth, that the Pope hath not onlie power to depoſe, but may alſo execute it without iniuſtice, the Prince depoſed hauing no probable right or Title remaining. And this is the opinion of all thoſe, who holde that the Pope can depoſe Princes, and this was the opinion of the Popes ſo learned, and ſo holie, that haue depoſed Princes, and ſo muſt thinke it more then probable, elſe the Prince (as I ſaid) after depoſition should retaine probable right, and ſo being alſo in Poſſeſſion, could not iuſtlie be depoſed.</p>

               <p n="24">24. This might ſerue to reiect this Clauſe as altogether vnlawfull to be ſworne: but yet for more full ſatisfaction of Catholicks in this point, I will bring another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prooue that it can not in conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be ſworne. Becauſe this Clauſe importeth that <hi>the Pope neither by him ſelfe, nor by any another Authority or meanes, can depoſe the King, or diſpoſe of any of his maieſties Dominions, or authorize any forraine Prince to anoy him, or inuade his countries, or diſcharge any of his ſubiects of their alleageance, or to giue licence or leaue to any of them to beare armes, raiſe tumults, or offer violence or hurt to his Maieſties Royall perſon, ſtate, or gouernment, or any his Maieſties ſubiects &amp;c.</hi> Wherein alſo is ſuch difficultie, that I can not ſee how in a matter ſo doubtfull, or not ſo certaine, a man may ſweare ſo peremptorily, and vndoubtedly. Who ſo pleaſeth to read <hi>Franciſcus de Victoria</hi> that learned <hi>Dominican,</hi> shall finde that he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe diuers Titles, by which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards might iuſtly inuade &amp; ſubdue the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> which Titles whether any Chriſtian Prince may haue to inuade <hi>England,</hi> or any other countrie, I will not diſpute, but onely alleadge them, that the Reader may ſee that it is not ſo euident that a man may take this
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:8380:173"/>Clauſe of the Oath in ſo generall termes as is lyeth, <hi>Victoria</hi> his opinion being no waies condemned, but rather approoued by many.

               </p>
               <p n="25">25. The firſt Title pertaining to this matter, which <hi>Victoria</hi> alleadgeth, is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which the Pope hath to ſend Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers euen to Infidels, much more to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Countries that be hereticks, becauſe ouer theſe he hath ſpirituall Iuriſdiction. And although Paganes can not be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to imbrace Chriſtian faith; yet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Preachers, after they haue giuen reaſon of their Embaſſage, may preach by that Authoritie, which CHRIST gaue to his Apoſtles and ſucceſſours, when he ſayd:
<q>
                     <hi>Euntes docete omnes gentes baptizantes eos &amp;c.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 28</note> Going therfore teach yee all nations baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> And if the Paganes would hinder their preaching, or after they haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched hinder the conuerſion of Infidels, and the fruit of preaching; they may with the ſouldiours, whome they carrie with them, force them to permitt them to preach, and to permitt all that will to heare them, and not to hinder their ſpirituall good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; and if otherwiſe they cannot purſue nor defend this their right, they may make warre vpon thoſe, that hinder them, and purſue all thoſe thinges which are lawfull in a iuſt warre. And by this Title (ſaith <hi>Victoria</hi>) the Spaniards might make warre vpon the <hi>Indians,</hi> if otherwiſe they
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8380:174"/>could not preach the Chriſtian faith, nor withſtand the obſtinate Pagans, who would hinder their conuerſion, that deſired to be Chriſtians.</q> And thus <hi>Victoria</hi> would ſay that the Pope might ſend Preachers to <hi>England,</hi> and might deſire and licence ſome Catholicke Prince to aſſiſt and defend the Preachers in procuring hereticks conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And if any hereticks woulde not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the Catholicke Doctours to preach, or would hinder the conuerſion of thoſe, that would be Catholicks, the forraine Prince licenced by the Pope, might in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid (as <hi>Victoria</hi> thinketh, for I will ſay nothing of my ſelfe) make warre vpon the English, and ſeeing that warre cannot (vnles by reaſon of ignorance) be iuſt on both ſides, the English, eſpecially who are Catholicks, could not defend thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them ſelues againſt this Prince, who aſſiſteth the Preachers. Thus would he ſay: but as I ſo honour my Prince, and loue my countrie, that I deſire not that any ſuch Title should take place in <hi>England,</hi> ſo I will not diſpute of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>26.Another Title (ſayth <hi>Victoria</hi>) by which the Spaniards might make warre on the Indians is, if after ſome of them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the Catholicke faith, the others would force them to Idolatrie, for then (ſayth he) the Spaniards might by armes defend them, they being become now their freinds and fellowes.</q>

                  <q>27.A third Title (ſayth he) might be this: If the <hi>India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> by lawfull or vnlawfull meanes, that is by peaceble preaching, or force and violence, were for the moſt part conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Pope to conſerue Religion might giue them a Chriſtian Prince, and ſend an Armie to put him in poſſeſſion.

               <p n="29">29. A fift Title may be grounded in the Popes temporall authoritie, for hee being a temporall Prince might authorize the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Vrbine</hi> for example, or other his Feudataries, to inuade <hi>England</hi> for ſatisfaction of iniuries, if the King of <hi>England</hi> had done him any, (for ſo the King of <hi>England</hi> hath heretofore inuaded <hi>France</hi> for iniuries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, and might againe hereafter, if by the French the like iniuries should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.) And yet this Clauſe of the Oath makes the Catholicke to ſweare, that <hi>the Pope neither by himſelfe, nor by any authoritie of the Church or Sea of Rome, or by any other meanes with any other, hath any power or authoritie to depoſe the King &amp;c. or to anoy him or inuade his countries &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. Another Title of inuading a Princes country or reſiſting him may be this. If Princes contrary to the Popes commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and liking of all other Princes, would call the Moores or Turkes into <hi>Spaine, France,</hi> or <hi>Germanie,</hi> and commaund their ſubiects to aſſiſt them; were they bound to obey, or rather were they not bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt what they could? And ſeeing that the bringing of the Moores or Turkes into thoſe countries might bee preiudiciall to all Chriſtian countries, and euen to Chriſtian faith; might not other Princes, eſpecially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by their Chiefe viſible Paſtour, inuade their countries to hinder the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of ſuch enemies? And might nor, yea ought not the Emperour, and thoſe
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:8380:175"/>Princes ſubiects, to aſſiſt them againſt their owne Princes for the common good of Chriſtendome? And yet by this Clauſe we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to ſweare that the Pope in no caſe can authorize ſubiects or Princes to annoy his Maieſtie of <hi>England,</hi> or any his countries.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Wherefore although I will not auerre, that Chriſtian Princes may haue theſe titles to inuade <hi>England,</hi> or any part of it, or to make warre, either againſt the Prince (to whom I wish after long life hete eternity in heauen) or countrie, which is moſt deare vnto mee; Yet by this it may eaſily appeare, that it is not ſo euident, as <hi>VViddrington</hi> would make it, that this Oath may be taken with ſuch an aſſured aſſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and in thoſe ſo generall termes, <hi>Victoria</hi> hauing alleadged ſo many Titles of iuſt warres, which make this Clauſe at leaſt doubtfull, and ſo not to be ſworne.</p>

                  <hi>VViddrington</hi> anſwereth that in this Clauſe is not denyed that the Common wealth can depoſe a Prince, but only is auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Pope cannot either by himſelfe, or by the Common wealth, or any other meanes. And (ſaith he) if the Pope cannot by himſelfe, neither can hee by the Common wealth. And this (as he thinketh) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth by examples. For (ſaith he) as a ſtone neither with a man, neither by a man hath power to vnderſtand and diſoourſe, and neither by the Common wealth, nor
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:8380:176"/>with the Common wealth can depoſe a Prince, becauſe it hath no power of it ſelfe to diſcourſe or depoſe: ſo if wee ſuppoſe that the Pope of him ſelfe hath no power to depoſe a Prince, he cannot by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth depoſe him, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife the Common wealth could. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (ſaith <hi>Widdrington</hi>) theſe examples be not like in all points, becauſe the ſtone is not capable at all of diſcourſing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, the Pope is at leaſt capable of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to depoſe Princes, if God would giue it him, yet (ſaith he) if wee ſuppoſe that the Pope <hi>de facto</hi> hath no power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then a good argument may be drawne out of theſe ſimilitudes. For as the ſtone cannot by man, or with a man diſcourſe, or depoſe Kings, becauſe it hath no power of it ſelfe ſo to doe: ſo if the Pope haue no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to depoſe Princes (as <hi>Widdrington</hi> ſuppoſeth it cannot be, or is not yet ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prooued that he hath) he cannot <hi>de facto</hi> by the Common wealth depoſe.</p>
               <p n="33">33. But I shall make <hi>VViddrington</hi> to ſee by other examples and reaſon alſo, how litle theſe his examples auaile. For ſuppoſe the Pope could not depoſe a Prince by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (as I haue prooued he can) yet he might doe it by a temporall Prince, or the Common wealth, and that alſo in <hi>VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringtons</hi> opinion. This I prooue <hi>firſt</hi> by examples. For in the opinion of thoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who ſay that no ſubſtance is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:8380:176"/>operatiue or actiue, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or ſubſtantiall forme of fire can not produce fire immediately by it ſelfe, and yet it can <hi>per calorem &amp; ſiccitatem,</hi> by heate and ſiccity, which are the fires inſtrument and actiue virtue; and ſo wee ſay not only that heate produceth heate, but alſo that fire produceth heate, though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but by meanes of the foreſaid qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. So the ſunne engendreth metalls and mineralls in the bowells of the earth, and produceth as an vniuerſall cauſe, plantes and hearbes; and yet not by his immediate ſubſtance, but by mediation of his light and influences. So the will of man is cauſe of walking, ſpeaking, and other externall operations, yet not by her ſelfe immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, but by mediation of other faculties, which are dependent on her. So a Prince that had neither hand nor foote, or if he had, should vſe neither, and ſo could not kill his enemie, yet might he doe it by his Captaine, if he should commaund him; and if at his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Captaine should kill, the Prince alſo should be ſaid to haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yea &amp; to haue bene the principall cauſe of the murder, though immediately he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not, or did not ſtrike any ſtroke. Wherefore <hi>VViddrington</hi> might haue called to mind, that many tymes an agent may worke an effect by another, which it can not by it ſelfe immediatly, if the other cauſe, which it vſeth, be dependent of it, or ſubordinate

               <p n="34">34. But as touching <hi>Widdringtons</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they are not to the purpoſe: for no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile that a ſtone cannot diſcourſe by, or with a man, a man being not ſubordinate to a ſtone, nor any inſtrument of it; and ſo as litle marueile it is, that a ſtone cannot depoſe a Prince by the Pope, as that <hi>VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> cannot be ſaid to low by an oxe, bleate by a sheepe, or beare fruite by a tree, here being no ſubordination or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as there is in the other examples by me alleadged, and in the power of the Prince and Common wealth, which euen by WIDDRNIGTONS confeſſion is dependent of the Popes authoritie, and may be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and commaunded by it.</p>
               <p n="35">35. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this I prooue by reaſon grounded in the opinion, which euen WIDDRINGTON himſelfe admitteth.

               <p n="36">36. Now if wee putte this together, we
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:8380:178"/>shall finde, that the Pope, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>widdringtons</hi> opinion, may depoſe a Prince by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, although he could not doe it by himſelfe immediately:

And therfore if <hi>VViddrington</hi> durſt not ſweare, that the theefe neither by him ſelfe, nor by any other cauſe can burne a houſe, if he can by applying the fier that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> burne it; how dareth he ſweare, that the Pope can not either by him ſelfe, or by any other cauſe depoſe a Prince, ſeing that he, by <hi>VViddringtons</hi> Confeſſion, can by his commaundement apply the common wealth, which is a cauſe <hi>per ſe,</hi> and ſufficient for ſuch an effect. Secondlie <hi>Widdrington</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeth his tearmes, in ſaying that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a cauſe by accident, for though he be no phiſicall cauſe of the effect, yet he is a morall cauſe, and in that kinde a principall cauſe, and a cauſe <hi>per ſe,</hi> which intendeth the effect, and moueth the commaunded as an inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; and the commaunded though he haue not alwaies from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunder true authoritie (becauſe ſometymes the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath none him ſelfe) yet he hath from him morall influence, and is ſayd to worke the effect by vertue of his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And ſo betwixt the commaunder and the applyer of fier to the ſtrawe, there is great difference: becauſe he that applyeth the fier, giueth no force nor actiuitie to the fier, &amp; ſo his application is but <hi>conditio ſine qua non,</hi> and he is <hi>cauſa per accidens:</hi> but the commaunder ſometimes giueth authoritie, and alwayes giueth morall influence and motion, (as doth the principall cauſe to the inſtrument) and ſo he is a principall cauſe and <hi>cauſa per ſe.</hi>

In the <hi>Firſt</hi> kinde are comprehended all Lordes or Maſters, who commaund theire ſeruantes, or miniſters to kill them, whom they them ſelues haue no Authoritie to kill. So if a Captaine should commaund his man to kill his enemie, or one that ſtandeth in his way of preferment, or one whoſe wife or purſe he deſireth to haue, he is ſayd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie to be the principall cauſe,

But although this Clauſe ſeeme to ſuppoſe, and the King in wordes ſeemeth to confeſſe, or at leaſt not to denie the Pope Authoritie to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, yet in effect they denie it.

For firſt if we ſpeake of the power of Excommunication and depriuation (of which I ſpeake but two lines before theſe wordes at which <hi>VViddrington</hi> carpeth) I had shewed in the ſeauenth Chapter before, that the power to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate which the cbiefe viſible Paſtour hath, is one and the ſelfe ſame power with the power of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and depoſition; which one power hath two actes and effectes, the one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and firſt intended called <hi>actus prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and this is Excommunication, or ſuch like ſpirituall Cenſure and punishment; the ſecond is depriuation, depoſition, and ſuch like Temporall chaſtiſement and correction, which is <hi>actus ſecundarius,</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarie acte of the Chiefe Paſtours ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall power ſecondarilie intended when the firſt will not preuaile.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:8380:184"/>not that this power muſt needes alwayes <hi>exerciſe</hi> both, or either of them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope can not haue this power, but he muſt haue facultie to exerciſe them when a iuſt cauſe requireth it: and ſo theſe two actes being neceſſarilie belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Popes Supremacie, he that denyeth him power to depriue or depoſe a Prince, denyeth in effecte that he hath power to Excommunicate, it being one and the ſelfe ſame power: becauſe the denyall of an effect neceſſarilie belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to a cauſe, is a virtuall denyall of the cauſe; euen as to deny that fier can heate, or rarifie, is to deny it to be fier, and to deny a man to be <hi>riſibilis,</hi> is to deny him to be man. Secondlie if we ſpeake of theſe two actes of this power (although WIDDRNIGTON knoweth that the learned SVAREZ alleaged by him,

And ſo the acte of Depriuation being at leaſt a ſecondarie acte of the Popes ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Supremacie; to deny that he hath power to depriue, is to deny that he hath power to excommunicate, it being all one power, and conſequentlie it is to deny couertlie his ſpirituall Supremacie.</p>
               <p n="45">45. But beſides this, all the Argumentes, which I haue alleadged to prooue that the Pope can depoſe Princes, and all which I haue ſayd againſt the former two Clauſes, do manifeſtly prooue that this Clauſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the three companions of an Oath, and ſo can not lawfullie be ſworne. That <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> wanteth, it may appeare by that, which I haue ſayd in the verie beginning of my examination of this Oath. That it wanteth <hi>Veritie,</hi> it is as euident, as it is that the Pope can depoſe Princes. And though it were but probable that the Pope could degrade Princes, yet to ſweare abſolutely that he can not, were to expoſe the ſwearer to daunger of periurie; yea it were to ſweare a falſehood, and ſo to committ actuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie. For as it is periurie to ſweare as true
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:8380:188"/>that which is falſe, ſo is it to ſweare a thing to be vndoubtedly and aſſuredly true, which is but probable; becauſe it is falſe, that that which is but probable, is abſolutely, and aſſuredly true.

And although if the Pope should excommuntcate and depoſe a Prince, a ſubiect in ſome caſe might yet obey in lawfull thinges, becauſe feare of death, or loſſe of liuings would excuſe him, when otherwiſe it is no ſcandall, nor no abſolute fruſtration of the Cenſure to obey him in particular; yet to ſweare this in ſo generall termes, can not be lawfull, as not only my former Arguments, but alſo euen that, which out of <hi>Victoria</hi> I haue alleaged, doth manifeſtlie prooue.</p>
               <p n="46">46. That this Clauſe wanteth alſo the third companion &amp; condition of a lawfull oath, which is <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> is as manifeſt, becauſe it derogateth from the Authoritie, which the Pope iuſtlie claymeth, and hath of long

               <p n="47">47 <hi>Widdrington</hi> anſwereth that to make the poſition here abiured as hereticall, it is ſufficient that one part of it be hereticall, to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:8380:189"/>witt, that Princes excommunicated by the Pope, may be murthered. And therefore although it be not hereſie to ſay that Princes excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed; yet ſeing that at leaſt it is hereticall to ſay, that they may be killed, it being flat againſt Scripture which forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth abſolutely to kill,

               <p n="48">48. That it is ſufficient, to make the <hi>poſition</hi> here abiured hereticall, that the laſt part thereof be hereticall, WIDDRINGTON prooueth; becauſe (ſayth he) the word <hi>(May)</hi> when it goeth before the Coniunction <hi>(or)</hi> ſignifieth that it is in our free choice and election to do the one or the other, and therefore (ſayth he) though the propoſitton ſeeme to be diſiunctiue, yet it is not an abſolute, but a conditionall diſiunctiue, aequiualent to a Copulatiue. And ſo to ſweare that it is hereticall doctrine to ſay that Princes excommunicated and depriued by the Pope, may by their ſubiects, or any others be depoſed or murdered; is to ſweare that it is hereticall doctrine to ſay that after the Prince is excommunicated and depriued by the Pope, it is in the free election of his ſubiects or others to depoſe him, or kill him, as they will, which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall; becauſe at leaſt they cannot kill him, as is prooned. And to prooue that this is the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:8380:190"/>meaning of that Clauſe, he alleageth many examples and manners of ſpeeches, which haue the ſame ſenſe: as if one should ſay: <hi>You may eate or drinke. You may go by horſe, or on ſoote:</hi> The meaning is, you may do of theſe which you will.</p>
               <p n="49">49. But this his Anſwer (by his leaue) is not ſufficient to ſatisfie anie timorous or rightely fearefull conſcience. For <hi>firſt,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometimes the Coniunction <hi>(Or)</hi> when it followeth the verbe <hi>(may)</hi> be taken in the meaning that <hi>Widdrington</hi> affirmeth, yet not alwaies; yea ordinarily it is taken diſiunctiuelie. And ſo, as to verifie a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiue propoſition,</hi> it is ſufficient that one part of it be true; ſo to make it falſe, both parts muſt be falſe. As for example, if one should lay a wager, that to morrow it will either raine or ſnowe, to winne the wager, it is ſufficient that it do either; but to make the propoſition falſe, and to cauſe him to looſe his wager, neither muſt happen, that is, it muſt neither raine, not ſnowe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that the Coniunction <hi>(or)</hi> is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily taken diſiunctiuelie, and many times alſo when <hi>(may)</hi> goeth before it; it remaineth yet to be prooued by <hi>VViddrington</hi> that <hi>(or)</hi> is taken copulatiuelie in the Clauſe alleadged. As for example if one should ſay: <hi>It is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall to ſay that a man may ſteale or committ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutrie,</hi> in that propoſition <hi>(or)</hi> is taken diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiuelie, and the propoſition importeth that it is hereticall to ſay that a man may
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:8380:190"/>either ſteale or committ aduoutrie: Or (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may ſay this is true by reaſon of the matter not of the forme) if he should ſay: I dereſt as hereſie that Poſition which ſayth, that a man may be baptized of an Heretieke either lawfullie <hi>or validlie,</hi> were it not a falſe and hereticall deteſtation? and yet by reaſon of one parte of the diſiunctiue propoſition, to wit, <hi>or validlie.</hi> The verie like (as who ſo marketh shall perceaue) is the propoſition alleadged; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it importeth, that it is an hereticall propoſition, to ſay that Prince excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and depriued by the Pope, may be either depoſed or killed. Whence it cometh to paſſe, that the partie who ſweareth that Clauſe, shall ſweare that it is hereticall to ſay that Princes excommunicated by the Pope may be depoſed, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is no where condemned as hereticall, yea is decreed by Generall Councells, and practiſed by many holie and learned Popes, allowed of by common conſent, and laſtely confeſſed by <hi>VViddrington</hi> himſelfe as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p n="50">50. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> ſeeing that this manner of ſpeech is often, yea ordinarily taken in a diſiunctiue meaning, it maketh this Clauſe at leaſt doubtfull, whether it alſo be not taken diſiunctiuelie, and ſo importe that it is hereticall to ſay that a Prince excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated may be depoſed. And ſeeing that no man can ſweare a doubtfull thing, leaſt he
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:8380:191"/>expoſe himſelfe to periurie in ſwearing falſe, and conſequently make himſelfe guiltie indeed of periurie, becauſe euerie one is eſteemed guiltie of that ſinne or crime,

So that <hi>VViddrington</hi> by this expoſition making the ſwearer to ſweare onlie that the Kinge exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated cannot be killed, ſecureth him not from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or depriuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no nor from killing, as I haue shewed, and ſo maketh the oath

Fourthlie although for the reſpect I owe and beare to Princes, and eſpecially to my owne naturall Liege, I will not auerre that Princes perſiſting in poſſeſſion and gouernment of their Kingdome, after that the Pope hath excommunicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued them, may be depoſed, and killed alſo by their former ſubiectes, or any other power or potentate: yet ſeeing that many do affirme and holde it, whoſe opinion not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is no waies cenſured for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, or ſo much as temerarious, or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; I do not ſee how that poſition, though taken in <hi>VViddringtons</hi> ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, can be abiured as hereticall.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 43. 52. 103.</note> The firſt which hee giueth in his <hi>New-yeares-guifte,</hi> is in effect this: It is but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion that the Pope can depoſe a Prince, and ſo after the Sentence of depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or depriuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Prince depoſed hath probable right and Title, and ſo being in Poſſeſſion, the Pope cannot iuſtlie depoſe him, becauſe better is the condition of the Poſſeſſour. Wherefore as it is lawfull to ſweare that it is hereticall to ſay that a man may ſteale, or kill his neightbour by priuate Authoritie and not in his owne defence, or thruſt him out of his owne howſe; ſo it is as lawfull to ſweare that it is hereſie: to ſay
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:8380:193"/>that the Pope may depoſe a Prince, it being open Iniuſtice to diſpoſſeſſe him, who hath probable right and Title. And if you obiect that it is not againſt any definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Church or Councell to ſay that the Pope can depoſe a Prince, and ſo cannot bee hereticall: hee anſwereth that it is againſt Scripture, which forbiddeth iniuſtice, and that this is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make the aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereſie, which affirmeth it lawfull. But to omit that it is the manner of heretiques to ſquare all by Scripture, and not by the Churches definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: this anſweare firſt ſuppoſeth it to be an opinion onlie probable, that the Pope can depoſe a Prince, and yet aboue I haue prooued it, no leſſe then certayne by manie Arguments, and by this in particular, that if it were but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the Decree of the Councell of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane, and the facts of manie holie Popes who haue depoſed Princes, should bee all vniuſt; which with what modeſtie <hi>Widdr.</hi> can graunt, I reporte mee to all modeſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes. And if it bee certaine that the Pope can depoſe a Prince, then it is not probable, that the Prince depoſed hath probable right, but rather it is certaine he hath not, and ſo Poſſeſſion without probable Title being not ſufficient (for that euen theeues haue ſuch poſſeſſion) it followeth that the Pope may depoſe a Prince without all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, and ſo it cannot bee an hereſie to teach that the Pope can depoſe a Prince, and conſequentlie that poſition can not bee
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:8380:194"/>abiured as hereſie. Secondlie the power to depoſe, and the exerciſe of this power being two things (as aboue wee haue ſeen) in ſo much that one may haue power and yet can not lawfullie exerciſe it, nor ſome tymes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidlie; and this clauſe of the oath not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As, ſaith hee, if one should ſay I deteſt him as a deuill, I loue him as my brother, he doth not therefore affirme him to be truelie a deuill, or trulie his Brother. And when S. GREGORIE ſaith,

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:8380:194"/>to what Shifts <hi>VViddrington</hi> is driuen. For firſt the King and Parlament doe hold it as a poſition truelie hereticall that the Pope can depriue, or that the Subiects can depoſe &amp; kill him whom the Pope depriueth: and ſo it is moſt like that in this Clauſe they intend that the ſwearer should abiure that poſition as truelie hereticall. Secondlie thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, execrating, and thundring wordes: <hi>I doe further ſweare that I doe from my heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, deteſt and abiure as impious &amp; hereticall this da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable doctrine and poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi> doe argue that the ſwearer deteſteth that poſition as in deede hereticall, impious, and damnable; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if after ſo great wordes of abiuration hee should abiure it onlie as approching or ſomething like to hereſie, wee might ſay, <hi>parturiunt montes naſcetur ridiculus mus.</hi> neither are <hi>VViddringtons</hi> examples to the purpoſe, becauſe it being euident that hee whom wee deteſt as a deuill, can not be trulie a deuill, and that hee whom wee loue as our brother, can not bee our true brother; it muſt needes ſignifie onlie ſimilitude not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie; but ſeing that it is not euident <hi>in terminis,</hi> as the former poſitions are, that that poſition can not bee hereſie, and that the Authours of the oathe doe hold it for hereſie, it followeth that in this place (as) muſt ſignifie equalitie or identitie, not ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude:

Thirdlie it is at leaſt doubtfull leaſt this may bee the ſenſe, to witt, that the poſition is truelie hereſie, ſpeciallie ſeing that the wordes and manner of ſpeeche (as WID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRINGTON confeſſeth) are to bee taken in the Common ſenſe, and according to the Lawemakers intention, <hi>ergo</hi> this is a clauſe, not to bee digeſted by anie tymerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor by any other, then by an all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring conſcience.</p>

In this Clauſe firſt is abiured all power to diſpenſe in oathes and vowes, which is hereticall, it being a matter of faith conformable to common conſent and to the Canons and practiſe of the Church, that the Pope can diſpenſe in oathes and vowes, when there is iuſt cauſe. And if in other oathes, why not in this? <hi>VViddrington</hi> perchaunce will anſwere, that this Oath of Alleageance bindeth by law of God and Nature, in which the Pope cannot diſpenſe. But he cannot be ignorant that all oathes and vowes do bynde by law of

<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Vouete &amp; reddite: Vow and render.</hi> And yet if hee will be a Catholicke, he muſt confeſſe, that the Pope can, and often times hath, and doth diſpenſe in ſome oathes and vowes, as in a vow to make a longe pilgrimage, or to giue a ſumme of mony to a Church or Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, which are temporall things, though ordained to a ſpirituall end: and why then can he not diſpenſe in this for a good end, to wit, conſeruation of faith, and vpon iuſt cauſe, as certes, if euer there be iuſt cauſe to diſpence, then there is, when the Prince with intolerable Tyrannie perſecuteth faith and Religion?</p>
               <p n="56">56. And therefore <hi>VViddrington</hi> should call to minde that diſtinction, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines vſe in this matter, to wit, that there is <hi>duplex ius dininum naturale,

So that to ſweare that the Pope hath no Authoritie to diſpenſe with a ſubiect in his Oath, by which he hath ſworne fidelitie to the King, where as notwithſtanding, when the King is an intollerable Tyrant, there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

For although it be no good Argument to argue <hi>à particulari ad vniuerſale,</hi> and to ſay, The Pope can not diſpenſe in this Oath, <hi>ergo</hi> in none: yet when there is the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:8380:196"/>ſame reaſon of the particular, which is in the vniuerſall, then to deny the particular, were to deny the vniuerſall. And therefore as to ſay, <hi>Peter</hi> (who is a man as well as others) <hi>is not riſihilis,</hi> were in effect to ſay that <hi>nullus homo eſt riſibili;</hi> ſo ſeeing there is the ſame reaſon of this Oath to Wards the Prince, which is of other oathes, he that denieth that the Pope can diſpenſe in this Oath, denyeth alſo in effect that he can diſpenſe in any oath at all.</p>
               <p n="57">57. This power, which the Pope hath in diſpenſing in this Oath, I confirme by all that, which aboue I haue alleaged to proue that the Pope can depoſe Princes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue ſubiects from their alleageance, and euen by the power of binding and looſing,

And ſo it being a thing at leaſt verie doubtfull, whether the Prince and Magiſtrate haue authority to propoſe ſuch an oath; yea it being euident that they cannot, becauſe (as aboue is prooued) it is euident that it containeth many things, which are againſt faith, and Authoritie of the Church and Councells: the Prince and Magiſtrate can haue no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie at all, much leſſe full and lawfull Autho itie, to propoſe this Oath.

               <p n="60">60. Adde to this, that, what ſoeuer VVIDDRINGTON ſaith, the King and Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by this oath, do take vppon them to decide what power the Pope hath from Chriſte the Authour and S.

As for Example the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:8380:198"/>Church defineth, that there are 7. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and pronounceth <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt the contrarie opinion which ſaith there are but two or not. 7. Doth shee not in this define the queſtion? Euen ſo our Prince and Parlament by this oathe haue decreed, that the Pope can not depoſe or depriue a Prince, and they oblige the Subiect to ſweare this parte, and to abiure the contrarie as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:8380:204"/>maketh shew of many bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares &amp; Scarrcrowes of daungers hanging ouer the Kinges head by reaſon of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Common opinion by mee and others euen the moſt learned, defended, ſo to inſinuate him ſelfe for a zealous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: yet if wee looke better into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wee shall ſee, that all this is but a needles feare, &amp; that ther is morallie no ſuch thing to be feared. And therfore Catholicke Kinges notwithſtanding this opinion which they approoue, do not therfore think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in leſſe ſecuritie. But he will ſaye that our Soueraigne being of a contrarie Religion, hath iuſt cauſe to feare. Let him then write bookes to perſwade his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, and therby put him out of this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded feare. Yet ſuppoſe he neither will nor can perſwade that; I deny that there is any ſuch daunger, as WIDDRINGTON maketh shewe of. For bee it (as in deed it is) that the Pope can in ſome caſe depoſe a Prince, as when he is incompatible or intolerable for his ſpirituall tyrannie; yet that caſe happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſeeldome, and when it happeneth, he often tymes ought not depoſe him, as if hee forſee more hurte then good will enſewe theron; &amp; he muſt giue the Prince warning and admonition, before he pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication or depoſition; to which if the Prince harken, the Pope can proceed no farther. And if his admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be contemned, he muſt not with out
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:8380:205"/>Counſell, actuallie excommunicate, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, to which perchaunce, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers will not aggree: and if both he, and they aggree to haue him depoſed, yet the particular Subiectes can not put the Prince out of Poſſeſſion; onlie the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, or publique Authoritie hath ſuch power; which yet the Common wealth can ſeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem exequute, and is not bound alwaies to execute, but may ſtill obey the Prince Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated &amp; depoſed in lawfull thinges, if by diſobeying him, any notable daunger is like to be incurred, as I haue shewed aboue in the thirtenth Chapter. And ſeing that theſe Circumſtances do ſeeldome all meet, depoſition of a King is <hi>rara auis in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and the exequution of the ſentence of depoſition is yet rarer, and conſequent lie not ſo much to bee feared, as <hi>VViddrington</hi> would haue it. And therfore <hi>VViddrington,</hi> if he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reallie to ſecure the Prince, should not defend the Oathe, as hetherto he hath done, but rather perſwaded the Prince to take it quite a waye, ther being perchaunce ſome daunger to him in vrging an odious oath apte to breed alienation in the ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes myndes, and no morall daunger at all (as I haue shewed) in not vrging it at all; the ſentence of depoſition of a Prince being a rare thing, and the exequution of it farre rarer. Heere I might conclude, but that I haue a word or twoe to ſay to <hi>Widdrington</hi> vpon occaſion of his <hi>Newyeares-guifte,</hi> and as
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:8380:205"/>much to the Catholique ſubiectes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their obedience to the King, and laſtlie to his Maieſtie concerning his confidence which he may ſecurelie put in them.</p>

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:8380:207"/>and that alſo probable. Out of this I frame this Argument: A ſubiect is bound to obey his lawfull Superiour when he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth according to a probable opinion, though he commaund a thing againſt the ſubiectes opinion, and that alſo probable: but the Pope <hi>VViddrington</hi> lawfull Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, commaunding <hi>VViddrington</hi> not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Oath of pretended allegeaunce, commaundeth at leaſt according to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion: <hi>ergo VViddrington</hi> is bound to obey the Pope in this againſt his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though that were alſo probable. The Maior <hi>Vaſquez</hi> proueth; becauſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect may follow any mans probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and conſequentlie his Superiours, that alſo being probable; and if he may, he muſt; becauſe his Superiour commaundeth. The Minor <hi>VViddrington</hi> graunteth, and can not deny: the Concluſion then followeth, to wit, that <hi>VViddrington</hi> is bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and vnder payne of mortall ſinne (the thing commaunded being of great im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) to deſiſt from defending the oath, the Pope hauing condemned it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding him not to defend it. To ſay that the Pope is miſinformed, and that therfore his declaration and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therin, doth not bynd in conſcience, is but a poore ſtay for <hi>VViddringtons</hi> conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; becauſe,

To alleage his Authours, is to litle purpoſe, they being (as aboue wee haue ſeen) few, and of litle or no Authoritie. To ſay the Pope may erre, wil as litle ſeue <hi>VViddringtons</hi> turne, becauſe euerie lawfull Superiour is to be obeyed when he commaundeth according to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion; though in other things, and euen in this he may erre. To anſwer that he is then onlie bound to obey his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour when ther is no notable daunger or domage in obeying; is as litle to the purpoſe: partlie becauſe the opinion according to which the Pope commaundeth, is more then probable, as aboue is proued; partlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though ther may be Temporall doma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in refuſing to take the oath, yet for <hi>VVid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> not to defend it by publique writing, ther is no more dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to many moe who neuer ſet pen to paper for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it; rather <hi>VViddrington</hi> should feare the ſpirituall daunger and domage which is incurred either by defending or taken it, as his chiefe Paſtour hath aſſured him.</p>
